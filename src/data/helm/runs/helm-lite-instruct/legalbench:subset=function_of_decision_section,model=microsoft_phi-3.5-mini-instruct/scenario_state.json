But the district court found that when Turner commanded Jones to stop she could not see that Jones was wearing headphones, and the court determined that it was reasonable for her to treat Jones's nonresponsiveness as grounds for suspicion. App. 107-08, 121-22; see also United States v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266, 277, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002) (\u201cA determination that reasonable suspicion exists ... need not rule out the possibility of innocent conduct.\u201d). The district court viewed the bodycam footage and credited Turner and Ennis\u2019 testimony, App. 121-22, and nothing in the record suggests that that the court's findings were clearly erroneous.

Lawrence then filed a motion for sentence reduction, but the district court reduced his sentence only by the ten months needed to comply with the new statutory maximum."

In 2018, Congress enacted the First Step Act, Pub. L. No. 115-391, \u00a7 404, 132 Stat. 5194, 5222, which permits defendants sentenced for certain crack offenses before August 3, 2010, to seek sentence reductions because of the profound (and disproportionately racial) disparity in the law's prior treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses. Lawrence then filed a motion for sentence reduction, but the district court reduced his sentence only by the ten months needed to comply with the new statutory maximum.\nFunction:",

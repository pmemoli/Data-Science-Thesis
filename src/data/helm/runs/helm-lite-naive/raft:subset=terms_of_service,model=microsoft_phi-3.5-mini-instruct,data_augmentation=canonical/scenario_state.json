        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Tripadvisor does not knowingly collect da information of any1 under da age of 13.\nLabel:",

Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may not use the services (other than certain commercial tools) to sell a product or service, increase traffic to your own website or a third-party website for commercial reasons, such as advertising sales, or otherwise undertake any endeavor aimed at deriving revenue.\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Youu may not use da services (other den certain commercial tools) to sell a product or service, increase traffic to ur own website or a third-party website fa commercial reasons, such as advertising sales, or otherwise undertake any endeavor aimed at deriving revenue.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence:  we   believe  that   ytou  own   your   data  and  preserving   your access   to such  data   is  important.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: We believe dat you own yo data and preserving ur access to such data is important.\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence:   yuo agree that all of yahoo's trademarks,  trade names, service  markes   and other  yahoo   logos  and brand   features, and  product and  service  names   are  trademarks  and the   property of   yahoo  holdings, inc.

Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: U agree dat all of yahoo's trademarks, trade names, service marks and other yahoo logos and brand features, and product and service names r trademarks and da property of yahoo holdings, inc.

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Depending on the third party accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such third party accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your third party accounts will be available on and through your account on the site and services.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence:   depending   on the   third  party   accounts   you  choose   and   subject  to the  privacy  settings   that  you've  set in   such   third party  accounts,  personally identifiable information  that   you  post   to   your  third  party  accounts   will be available on  and through  your account   on  the   site  and  services.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: 2.4 you grant certain content licenses to other users by submitting your content to publicly accessible areas of the service.\nLabel:",

Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence: 2.4   you grant   certain   content licenses to other  users by submitting  your  content  to  publically   accessible areas  of thge  service.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Use of the fitbit service should not replace your good judgment and common sense.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Use of da fitbit service should not replace ur good judgment and common sense.\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You will not solicit login information or access an account belonging to someone else.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: U will not solicit login information or access an account belonging to sum1 else.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence:  you  may   be able   to   access certain  third-party links,  applicaitons or   content   (``third-party  applications'')  via  accounts   related  to   our   services.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Youu may b able to access certain third-party links, applications or content (``third-party applications'') via accounts related to our services.\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence:   such   termination   or   suspension may  be   immediate  and  without  notice.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: We may revise these terms from time to time.\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence:  we  may   revise these terms from   time   to time.\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Notwithstanding any provision in the user agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to this agreement to arbitrate (other than an amendment to any notice address or site link provided herein) in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against ebay prior to the effective date of the amendment.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Notwithstanding any provision in da user agreement to da contrary, yu and we agree dat if we make any amendment to dis agreement to arbitrate (other den an amendment to any notice address or site link provided herein) in da future, dat amendment shall not apply to any claim dat was filed in a legal proceeding against ebay prior to da effective date of da amendment.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect.\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Any attempt by yu to assign or transfer dem terms, w/o such consent, gon be null and of no effect.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence: \u2022 attempt   to  probe, scan, or  test  the vulnerability of   any   academia.edu system  or   network  or breach  any  security or   authentication  measures ; \nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: \u2022 attempt to probe, scan, or test da vulnerability of any academia.edu system or network or breach any security or authentication measures ; \nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence: you're responsible  for identifying,   understanding, and   complying  with   all   laws, rules   and   regulations that apply to your   participation  in   an experience,   event   or other  host  service.\nLabel:",

We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: U are responsible fir identifying, understanding, and complying w all laws, rules and regulations dat apply to ur participation in an experience, event or other host service.\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: No oral or written information or advice given by the licensor or its authorized representative shall create a warranty.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence:   no  oral  or  written   information   or   advice given  by   the   licensor or  its authorized  representative shall  create a   warranty.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Fitbit will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.\nLabel:",

Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence: fitbit won't   seek  its attorneys'  fees  and  costs  in   arbitration   unless the arbitrator   determines that   your claim  is  frivolous.\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Fitbit gon not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless da arbitrator determines dat your claim is frivolous.\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Software development kits provided through skype developer on the skype website (including ``skypekit'') and the use of any application program interface (``api'') exposed or made available by skype are subject to their own licensing terms in which case such licensing terms will govern your use of that software.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Software development kits provided thru skype developer on da skype website (including ``skypekit'') and da use of any application program interface (``api'') exposed or made available by facetime are subject to their own licensing terms in which case such licensing terms gon govern ur use of dat software.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: 20.1 this section applies if you select a third-party payment system that enables you to pay for skype credit and certain paid for products via your mobile phone bill where applicable (``pay by mobile'').\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: 20.1 dis section applies if u select a third-party payment system dat enables yu to pay fir skype credit and certain paid fa products via ur mobile phn bill where applicable (``pay by mobile'').\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence:  except  for any claim  relating  to  your   or  our intellectual   property (such as trademarks,  trade  dress, domain  names,   trade   secrets,   copyrights   and   patents)  (``excluded disputes''),  you  and   onavo  agree  to   resolve  through final and   binding arbitration   any claim  between   you   and   onavo, including   its  affiliates,   officers, directors,  employees  and   agents anbd  its affiliates'  officers, directors,   employees  and agents   (whether  or   not  such   dispute also involves   a   third party),  regarding  any  aspect  of your relationship with us,  including  these  terms,   your  use   of any of   onavo's services, your   rights  of  privacy   and/or   publicity, or   any contacts  you  may have  with us,  driectly  or  indirectly, for any   reason  (``dispute'').\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Except fir any claim relating to ur or our intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents) (``excluded disputes''), u and onavo agree to resolve thru final and binding arbitration any claim between u and onavo, including its affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents and its affiliates' officers, directors, employees and agents (whether or not such dispute also involves a third party), regarding any aspect of ur relationship witt us, including dem terms, yo use of any of onavo's services, ur rights of privacy and/or publicity, or any contacts u may have w/ us, directly or indirectly, fir any reason (``dispute'').\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence:  take  any action  that   damages or   adversely  affects,  or   could  damage  or adversely  affect   tghe performance  or proper functioning  of   the airbnb  platform  ;   \nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Take any action dat damages or adversely affects, or could damage or adversely affect da performance or proper functioning of da airbnb platform ; \nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence: to  the maximum  extent   permitted  by   law, we  (together with   our   offcers,  directors,  employees, representatives,  affiliates, providers   and third   parties) don't   accept   any liability for (a) any inaccuracies  or omissions in hten   content  displayed on or   via the   skyscanner  services  adn/or   skyscanner platforms   ;  or   (b)  any   act   of   god,   accident,  delay   or   any special,  exemplary,  punitive, indirect,   incidental or  consequential  loss  or  damage  of   any  kind   (including,  without   limitation,   lost   profits   or lost savings),  whether  based in  contract,   tort   (including negligence),  strict  liability  or otherwise, incurred by you arising  out of or   in   connection with   your access to,  use   of,   or  inability to  access  or  use, tghe  skyscanner  services  and/or skyscanner   platforms   or any  content   contained provided therein.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: To da maximum extent permitted by law, we (together w our officers, directors, employees, representatives, affiliates, providers and third parties) do not accept any liability fir (a) any inaccuracies or omissions in da content displayed on or via da skyscanner services and/or skyscanner platforms ; or (b) any act of god, accident, delay or any special, exemplary, punitive, indirect, incidental or consequential loss or damage of any kind (including, w/o limitation, lost profits or lost savings), whether based in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise, incurred by yu arising outt of or in connection wit your access to, use of, or inability to access or use, da skyscanner services and/or skyscanner platforms or any content contained provided therein.\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence:   in  no event  shall linden lab   or  any of   its   directors, officers, employees,  shareholders,   subsidiaries, agents or  licensors  be  responsible  or liable to   you  or to  any third   party for any  loss or   damages  of   any kind,   including  for any direct,  indirect,  economic,   exemplary, incidental,   consequential, reliance,  special,  or  punitive   losses  or   damages or  disgorgement   or comparable equitable   remedy,  for lost data   or  lost   profits,  arising  (whether in   contract, tort, strict  liability   or otherwise)   out of or  in connection with   the  service  (including its   modification  or   termination),   the   software, the websites,  the   servers,  your   account   (including   its   termination   or  suspension)   or   this   agreement,  whether  or  not   linden   lab  may have  been   advised   that   any  such damages   might   or   coudl   occur and   notwithstanding   the  failure   of  essential   purpose   of   any  remedy.\nLabel:",

Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: In no event shall linden lab or any of its directors, officers, employees, shareholders, subsidiaries, agents or licensors b responsible or liable to youu or to any third party fir any loss or damages of any kind, including fir any direct, indirect, economic, exemplary, incidental, consequential, reliance, special, or punitive losses or damages or disgorgement or comparable equitable remedy, fa lost data or lost profits, arising (whether in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) outt of or in connection wit the service (including its modification or termination), da software, da websites, da servers, yo account (including its termination or suspension) or dis agreement, whether or not linden lab may have been advised dat any such damages mite or could occur and notwithstanding da failure of essential purpose of any remedy.\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence: 7.3  skype and/or   its  licensors retain exclusive   ownership  of the  software,   products   and  skype  websites and  all   intellectual property therein  (whether  or   not  registered   and  anywhere   in the   world).\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Currency quotes may not be updated on a daily basis.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence:  currency quotes  may  not   be updated on  a   daily  basis.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The services are provided by google inc.

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Da services r provided by google inc.

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, you acknowledge and agree that you shall have no ownership or other property interest in the account, and you further acknowledge and agree that all rights in and to the account are and shall forever be owned by and inure to the benefit of supercell.\nLabel:",

Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair.

Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court.

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence:   tinder  doesn't   represent or  warrant   thast (a)   the   service   wiull be  uninterrupted, secure  or error  free,   (b)  any  defects   or   errors   in  the   service wille   be  corrected,  or   (c) that  any content   or information  you  obtain  on   or   through ther  services  will  be  accurate.\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Tinder does not represent or warrant dat (a) da service gon be uninterrupted, secure or error free, (b) any defects or errors in da service gon be corrected, or (c) dat any content or information yu obtain on or thru the services gon be accurate.\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence:   we  can  each  end this  contract  anytime  we   want.\nLabel:",

Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: We can each end dis contract anytime we want.\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Supercell may reject, refuse to post or delete any user content for any or no reason, including, but not limited to, user content that in the sole judgment of supercell violates these terms of service.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence:  supercell   may reject,   refuse  to post   or delete  any  user   content   for  any   or no reason,  including, but   not limited  to,  user   content   that in  the sole  judgment  of supercell  violates   these  terms  of service.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: These requirements can be found on the website and the google, apple and amazon app marketplaces.\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence: these   requirements   can   be  found  on  the  website   and  the google,   apple   and amazon   app marketplaces.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Special provisions applicable to developers/operators of applications and websites \nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: These terms, and any other policies or rules we reference in these terms, make up the entire agreement between you and us relating to the subject matter of these terms, and supersede all prior understandings of the parties relating to the subject matter of these terms, whether those prior understandings were electronic, oral or written, or whether established by custom, practice, policy or precedent, between you and us.\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence:   these terms, and   any other policies   or rules we  reference  in   these terms,  make   up  the   entire   agreement  between   you  and us relating  to  the   subject   matter of these terms, and   supersede  all  prior   understandings of  the  parties   relating to the  subject matter  of  these terms,  whether those   prior   understandings were   electronic,   oral or  written, or whether  established  by  custom,  practice, policy  or   precedent, between   you and   us.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: \u2022 you are a small-scale independent production company, non-profit, or artist, in which case you may use the vimeo service to showcase or promote your own creative works.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: \u2022 yu are a small-scale independent production company, non-profit, or artist, in which case yu may use da vimeo service to showcase or promote ur own creative works.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: For notices made to members residing outside of germany, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which airbnb transmits the notice.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Fir notices made to members residing outside of germany, da date of receipt gon be deemed da date on which airbnb transmits da notice.\nLabel:",

Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: V) any content downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of our resources is done at your own discretion and risk, and that you are solely responsible for any damage to your computer or other devices for any loss of data that may result from the download of such content.\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence:  v)  any   content downloaded   or otherwise  obtained   through  the   use  of our resources is done   at   your own   discretion   and  risk,   and that  you're   solely  responsible for any   damage to   your   computer  or other  devices   for  any   loss   of  data that   may  result  from  the   download  of such  content.\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: V) any content downloaded or otherwise obtained thru the use of our resources is done at ur own discretion and risk, and dat you r solely responsible fir any damage to yo computer or other devices fa any loss of data dat may result from da download of such content.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence:   7.8 user  material  isn't  considered to be   confidential.\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: 7.8 user material is not considered to b confidential.\nLabel:",

If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence:   tihs website   may  contain  discussion  forums,  bulletin  boards, review  services   or olther forums in  which you or third parties   may  post   reviews   of  travel  experiences   or  other   content, messages,  materials  or other items  on   this website   (``interactive areas'').\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: F. does not contain any unsolicited or unauthorised advertising, promotional material, ``junk mail'', ``spam'', ``chain letters'', ``pyramid schemes'' or any other form of solicitation ; and \nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nsentence:   f.  doesn't   contain   any   unsolicited   or  unauthorised  advertising, promotional  material,  ``junk   mail'',   ``spam'',   ``chain   letters'',  ``pyramid  schemes''   or  any other  form of solicitation ;  and \nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Verified images (as defined below) are intended only to indicate a photographic representation of a listing at the time the photograph was taken, and are therefore not an endorsement by airbnb of any host or listing.\nLabel:",

        "prompt": "Label the sentence from a Terms of Service based on whether it is potentially unfair. If it seems clearly unfair, mark it as potentially unfair.\nAccording to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: 1) it has not been individually negotiated; and 2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer.\nDetails on types of potentially unfair clauses are found below:\nThe jurisdiction clause stipulates what courts will have the competence to adjudicate disputes under the contract. Jurisdiction clauses giving consumers a right to bring disputes in their place of residence were marked as clearly fair, whereas clauses stating that any judicial proceeding takes a residence away were marked as clearly unfair.\nThe choice of law clause specifies what law will govern the contract, meaning also what law will be applied in potential adjudication of a dispute arising under the contract. Clauses defining the applicable law as the law of the consumer's country of residence were marked as clearly fair. In every other case, the choice of law clause was considered as potentially unfair.\nThe limitation of liability clause stipulates that the duty to pay damages is limited or excluded, for certain kind of losses, under certain conditions. Clauses that explicitly affirm non-excludable providers' liabilities were marked as clearly fair. Clauses that reduce, limit, or exclude the liability of the service provider were marked as potentially unfair when concerning broad categories of losses or causes of them.\nThe unilateral change clause specifies the conditions under which the service provider could amend and modify the terms of service and/or the service itself. Such clause was always considered as potentially unfair.\nThe unilateral termination clause gives provider the right to suspend and/or terminate the service and/or the contract, and sometimes details the circumstances under which the provider claims to have a right to do so.\nThe contract by using clause stipulates that the consumer is bound by the terms of use of a specific service, simply by using the service, without even being required to mark that he or she has read and accepted them. We always marked such clauses as potentially unfair.\nThe content removal gives the provider a right to modify/delete user's content, including in-app purchases, and sometimes specifies the conditions under which the service provider may do so.\nThe arbitration clause requires or allows the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, before the case could go to court. Clauses stipulating that the arbitration should take place in a state other then the state of consumer's residence or be based on arbiter's discretion were marked as clearly unfair. Clauses defining arbitration as fully optional were marked as clearly fair.\nPossible labels:\n1. not potentially unfair\n2. potentially unfair\n\nSentence: The new rate will apply to your next phone call after the new rates have been published.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge and agree that posting any such user content may result in immediate termination or suspension of your spotify account.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You may opt-out of receiving text (sms) messages from uber at any time by following the directions found at http://t.uber.com/sms-unsubscribe.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Crowdtangle may change these terms of service, as described above, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any agreement between you and crowdtangle.\nLabel: potentially unfair\n\nSentence: You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such introduction, opinion, profile, advice, statement or information and any resulting participation or action shall be at your sole risk.\nLabel: not potentially unfair\n\nSentence: Verified images (as defined below) r intended only to indicate a photographic representation of a listenin at da time da photograph was taken, and r therefore not an endorsement by airbnb of any host or blastin.\nLabel:",

Your pastor should study Pearl Harbor...and the death that began from that point.   Brutal brutal people.  My uncle was a very refined man...eventually an Ambassador, high intellect, but he was a Marine infantry officer and saw the worst of it in WWII (close quarters, bayonets, eye gouging events)...and to the day he died he referred to them as \"Japs\". \n\nHave your pastor read about the rape of Nanking.

Those statues were not put up to honor those men in their communities, most of them were put up later during Jim Crow as a middle finger to those wishing for desegregation.\n\nThe more you know.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Why do people like you never complain about the riots that a certain class of people do every so often?  Why is it always the evil white man?   There are other  classes of mass killer that the left seems hell-bent on inviting into this country with their open doors policies and sanctuary cities.  Yes, on this last one, it was an atheist white guy,   However not all mass killers are white, and what does color have to do with it anyway?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: Malls do not cater to all, they cater to the women, to the young.  VRC, the Bon building been empty for so long, now with the Sports store gone, another large space available, one wonders what is the VRC looking for in a tenant.  The fad of shopping on line is very strong, but like most fads it will fade.  Retail, people wanted Box Stores, now they want the \"Mom and Pop\" store back.  What is being lost in the discussion is that the \"Baby Boomers\" make up a good share of the market, and they are being ignored.  No stores for men, don't count Macy, Penney, used to have stores that were just for men, now when a new store opens it is for women.  The demographic are not being used, money is being lost by companies.  As for this male, I give up, do little shopping, if in another city and find they have clothing stores for me will check them out, most of the time find something and so spend my money their and not here.  Maybe that is what the city wants, the stores want, go elsewhere.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Allan...  don't ask stupid questions like that.   Everyone knows that women were meant to bear men's children and much like a cow are incapable of any real thinking and as such should be kept bare foot and pregnant.   That's how god wanted it and the bible, which was obviously written at while taking straight dictation at god's foot is proof...

You don't see these people going to the orphanages and adopting all of the orphans to give them a good life. You don;t see them lining up to give money to the women who can't afford to feed their children..\n\nThese people don't care about these women and if the truth is known, they don't care about the babies either.

No stores for men, don't count Macy, Penney, used to have stores that were just for men, now when a new store opens it is for women.  The demographic are not being used, money is being lost by companies.  As for this male, I give up, do little shopping, if in another city and find they have clothing stores for me will check them out, most of the time find something and so spend my money their and not here.

No stores for men, don't count Macy, Penney, used to have stores that were just for men, now when a new store opens it is for women.  The demographic are not being used, money is being lost by companies.  As for this male, I give up, do little shopping, if in another city and find they have clothing stores for me will check them out, most of the time find something and so spend my money their and not here.  Maybe that is what the city wants, the stores want, go elsewhere.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Allan...  don't ask stupid questions like that.   Everyone knows that women were meant to bear men's children and much like a cow are incapable of any real thinking and as such should be kept bare foot and pregnant.   That's how god wanted it and the bible, which was obviously written at while taking straight dictation at god's foot is proof...  So there...\n\nAnd if she can't afford to feed her children well that's her fault.... \n< sarcasm off > \n\nFact is that if men had the babies populations would be much lower.  \n\nI would also argue that pro lifers are really pro birthers and that's all.  You don't see these people going to the orphanages and adopting all of the orphans to give them a good life. You don;t see them lining up to give money to the women who can't afford to feed their children..\n\nThese people don't care about these women and if the truth is known, they don't care about the babies either.  They only care about being able to tell someone else what to do.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: Accept what? Dirty jokes?\n\nThe Nasty Show at the Just for Laughs Festival is consistently one of the most popular shows.. for men and women.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: I'm guessing you're quite a literal kind of guy. You voted into office a man that bragged about grabbing women by their vaginas. Women don't like that. Nor do real men.  Rioting? A few but not the majority. There wasn't one arrest during the Women's March. Burning? Burning what? If you do want to talk about burning, did you read about the mosque in Texas that was burned down just a couple of days ago? I'm guessing you get your info from right wing blogs. You know where alternative facts are their mainstay and your reality?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

They rebelled and went to war to keep slaves. Those statues were not put up to honor those men in their communities, most of them were put up later during Jim Crow as a middle finger to those wishing for desegregation.\n\nThe more you know.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Why do people like you never complain about the riots that a certain class of people do every so often?  Why is it always the evil white man?   There are other  classes of mass killer that the left seems hell-bent on inviting into this country with their open doors policies and sanctuary cities.  Yes, on this last one, it was an atheist white guy,   However not all mass killers are white, and what does color have to do with it anyway?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: Malls do not cater to all, they cater to the women, to the young.

No stores for men, don't count Macy, Penney, used to have stores that were just for men, now when a new store opens it is for women.  The demographic are not being used, money is being lost by companies.  As for this male, I give up, do little shopping, if in another city and find they have clothing stores for me will check them out, most of the time find something and so spend my money their and not here.

Everyone knows that women were meant to bear men's children and much like a cow are incapable of any real thinking and as such should be kept bare foot and pregnant.   That's how god wanted it and the bible, which was obviously written at while taking straight dictation at god's foot is proof...

The parties on the left in the Weimar Republic were the Communists (KPD) and the Social Democrats (SPD). The National Socialists (Nazis) were right wing.\n\nYour characterization of Jeremy Christian as a leftist is not accurate. He's an angry and volatile man who was all over the political map. His Facebook postings also included support for Trump. This Oregonian June report provides a good description of Christian with many of his posts and statements:\n\nhttp://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2017/05/who_is_jeremy_christian_facebo.html\n\nSo the support for your claim \"So much hatred comes from the far left\" is to hold up a bizarre, angry murderer with no strong party affiliation, plus an incorrect characterization of the Nazis in Germany from 70+ years ago. There probably is some hatred among those of the extreme left, but you haven't shown it.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?"

What is being lost in the discussion is that the \"Baby Boomers\" make up a good share of the market, and they are being ignored.  No stores for men, don't count Macy, Penney, used to have stores that were just for men, now when a new store opens it is for women.  The demographic are not being used, money is being lost by companies.  As for this male, I give up, do little shopping, if in another city and find they have clothing stores for me will check them out, most of the time find something and so spend my money their and not here.  Maybe that is what the city wants, the stores want, go elsewhere.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Allan...  don't ask stupid questions like that.   Everyone knows that women were meant to bear men's children and much like a cow are incapable of any real thinking and as such should be kept bare foot and pregnant.   That's how god wanted it and the bible, which was obviously written at while taking straight dictation at god's foot is proof...

They rebelled and went to war to keep slaves. Those statues were not put up to honor those men in their communities, most of them were put up later during Jim Crow as a middle finger to those wishing for desegregation.\n\nThe more you know.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Why do people like you never complain about the riots that a certain class of people do every so often?  Why is it always the evil white man?   There are other  classes of mass killer that the left seems hell-bent on inviting into this country with their open doors policies and sanctuary cities.  Yes, on this last one, it was an atheist white guy,   However not all mass killers are white, and what does color have to do with it anyway?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: Malls do not cater to all, they cater to the women, to the young.  VRC, the Bon building been empty for so long, now with the Sports store gone, another large space available, one wonders what is the VRC looking for in a tenant.  The fad of shopping on line is very strong, but like most fads it will fade.  Retail, people wanted Box Stores, now they want the \"Mom and Pop\" store back.  What is being lost in the discussion is that the \"Baby Boomers\" make up a good share of the market, and they are being ignored.  No stores for men, don't count Macy, Penney, used to have stores that were just for men, now when a new store opens it is for women.  The demographic are not being used, money is being lost by companies.  As for this male, I give up, do little shopping, if in another city and find they have clothing stores for me will check them out, most of the time find something and so spend my money their and not here.  Maybe that is what the city wants, the stores want, go elsewhere.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Allan...  don't ask stupid questions like that.   Everyone knows that women were meant to bear men's children and much like a cow are incapable of any real thinking and as such should be kept bare foot and pregnant.   That's how god wanted it and the bible, which was obviously written at while taking straight dictation at god's foot is proof...  So there...\n\nAnd if she can't afford to feed her children well that's her fault.... \n< sarcasm off > \n\nFact is that if men had the babies populations would be much lower.  \n\nI would also argue that pro lifers are really pro birthers and that's all.  You don't see these people going to the orphanages and adopting all of the orphans to give them a good life. You don;t see them lining up to give money to the women who can't afford to feed their children..\n\nThese people don't care about these women and if the truth is known, they don't care about the babies either.  They only care about being able to tell someone else what to do.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: Accept what?

They rebelled and went to war to keep slaves. Those statues were not put up to honor those men in their communities, most of them were put up later during Jim Crow as a middle finger to those wishing for desegregation.\n\nThe more you know.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Why do people like you never complain about the riots that a certain class of people do every so often?  Why is it always the evil white man?   There are other  classes of mass killer that the left seems hell-bent on inviting into this country with their open doors policies and sanctuary cities.  Yes, on this last one, it was an atheist white guy,   However not all mass killers are white, and what does color have to do with it anyway?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: Malls do not cater to all, they cater to the women, to the young.  VRC, the Bon building been empty for so long, now with the Sports store gone, another large space available, one wonders what is the VRC looking for in a tenant.  The fad of shopping on line is very strong, but like most fads it will fade.  Retail, people wanted Box Stores, now they want the \"Mom and Pop\" store back.  What is being lost in the discussion is that the \"Baby Boomers\" make up a good share of the market, and they are being ignored.  No stores for men, don't count Macy, Penney, used to have stores that were just for men, now when a new store opens it is for women.  The demographic are not being used, money is being lost by companies.  As for this male, I give up, do little shopping, if in another city and find they have clothing stores for me will check them out, most of the time find something and so spend my money their and not here.  Maybe that is what the city wants, the stores want, go elsewhere.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Allan...  don't ask stupid questions like that.   Everyone knows that women were meant to bear men's children and much like a cow are incapable of any real thinking and as such should be kept bare foot and pregnant.   That's how god wanted it and the bible, which was obviously written at while taking straight dictation at god's foot is proof...  So there...\n\nAnd if she can't afford to feed her children well that's her fault.... \n< sarcasm off > \n\nFact is that if men had the babies populations would be much lower.  \n\nI would also argue that pro lifers are really pro birthers and that's all.  You don't see these people going to the orphanages and adopting all of the orphans to give them a good life. You don;t see them lining up to give money to the women who can't afford to feed their children..\n\nThese people don't care about these women and if the truth is known, they don't care about the babies either.  They only care about being able to tell someone else what to do.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: Accept what?

They rebelled and went to war to keep slaves. Those statues were not put up to honor those men in their communities, most of them were put up later during Jim Crow as a middle finger to those wishing for desegregation.\n\nThe more you know.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Why do people like you never complain about the riots that a certain class of people do every so often?  Why is it always the evil white man?   There are other  classes of mass killer that the left seems hell-bent on inviting into this country with their open doors policies and sanctuary cities.  Yes, on this last one, it was an atheist white guy,   However not all mass killers are white, and what does color have to do with it anyway?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: Malls do not cater to all, they cater to the women, to the young.  VRC, the Bon building been empty for so long, now with the Sports store gone, another large space available, one wonders what is the VRC looking for in a tenant.  The fad of shopping on line is very strong, but like most fads it will fade.  Retail, people wanted Box Stores, now they want the \"Mom and Pop\" store back.  What is being lost in the discussion is that the \"Baby Boomers\" make up a good share of the market, and they are being ignored.  No stores for men, don't count Macy, Penney, used to have stores that were just for men, now when a new store opens it is for women.  The demographic are not being used, money is being lost by companies.  As for this male, I give up, do little shopping, if in another city and find they have clothing stores for me will check them out, most of the time find something and so spend my money their and not here.  Maybe that is what the city wants, the stores want, go elsewhere.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Allan...  don't ask stupid questions like that.   Everyone knows that women were meant to bear men's children and much like a cow are incapable of any real thinking and as such should be kept bare foot and pregnant.   That's how god wanted it and the bible, which was obviously written at while taking straight dictation at god's foot is proof...  So there...\n\nAnd if she can't afford to feed her children well that's her fault.... \n< sarcasm off > \n\nFact is that if men had the babies populations would be much lower.  \n\nI would also argue that pro lifers are really pro birthers and that's all.  You don't see these people going to the orphanages and adopting all of the orphans to give them a good life. You don;t see them lining up to give money to the women who can't afford to feed their children..\n\nThese people don't care about these women and if the truth is known, they don't care about the babies either.  They only care about being able to tell someone else what to do.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: Accept what? Dirty jokes?\n\nThe Nasty Show at the Just for Laughs Festival is consistently one of the most popular shows.. for men and women.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Actually, like in North America, South American people are leaving Catholicism due to sexism and our refusal to ordain women equally to men, clericalism, child abuse, mandatory celibacy, and a lack of basic Christian behavior coming from our hierarchy and many of our parish members.  \n\nAn attitude of dismissal towards the gifts and practices of Charismatic Renewal over the past few decades, in our church (a style of worship which mirrors the prayer of Pentecostal worship) have cost us as well.

Those lives come from the power of a woman to give birth - to a whole new human life. That is far more powerful in creation than I believe anyone understands. In fact, since abortion would therefore jeopardize and undermine those lives coming into existence, that would therefore lead me to the conclusion and thought, woman undo the power of giving life which is given onto themselves by terminating human life in utero. Sure, a man must in some form and cooperation take on the task in the process of giving life anew through the her. But it's not a simple matter of fact as that. She has freewill as he does as well. For better posterity and love in the form of a relationship for those children, it is incumbent love/fidelity must exist. That therefore means women/men are not a utility, but loved.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?"

They only care about being able to tell someone else what to do.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: Accept what? Dirty jokes?\n\nThe Nasty Show at the Just for Laughs Festival is consistently one of the most popular shows.. for men and women.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: The dependency of the Church is that in order for either priests, or let alone deacons to exist, or even more so, for the reason for the Sacraments to be given, children, human lives,  must exist. Those lives come from the power of a woman to give birth - to a whole new human life. That is far more powerful in creation than I believe anyone understands. In fact, since abortion would therefore jeopardize and undermine those lives coming into existence, that would therefore lead me to the conclusion and thought, woman undo the power of giving life which is given onto themselves by terminating human life in utero. Sure, a man must in some form and cooperation take on the task in the process of giving life anew through the her. But it's not a simple matter of fact as that. She has freewill as he does as well. For better posterity and love in the form of a relationship for those children, it is incumbent love/fidelity must exist. That therefore means women/men are not a utility, but loved.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

They rebelled and went to war to keep slaves. Those statues were not put up to honor those men in their communities, most of them were put up later during Jim Crow as a middle finger to those wishing for desegregation.\n\nThe more you know.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Why do people like you never complain about the riots that a certain class of people do every so often?  Why is it always the evil white man?   There are other  classes of mass killer that the left seems hell-bent on inviting into this country with their open doors policies and sanctuary cities.

The fad of shopping on line is very strong, but like most fads it will fade.  Retail, people wanted Box Stores, now they want the \"Mom and Pop\" store back.  What is being lost in the discussion is that the \"Baby Boomers\" make up a good share of the market, and they are being ignored.  No stores for men, don't count Macy, Penney, used to have stores that were just for men, now when a new store opens it is for women.  The demographic are not being used, money is being lost by companies.  As for this male, I give up, do little shopping, if in another city and find they have clothing stores for me will check them out, most of the time find something and so spend my money their and not here.

Everyone knows that women were meant to bear men's children and much like a cow are incapable of any real thinking and as such should be kept bare foot and pregnant.   That's how god wanted it and the bible, which was obviously written at while taking straight dictation at god's foot is proof...

They rebelled and went to war to keep slaves. Those statues were not put up to honor those men in their communities, most of them were put up later during Jim Crow as a middle finger to those wishing for desegregation.\n\nThe more you know.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Why do people like you never complain about the riots that a certain class of people do every so often?  Why is it always the evil white man?   There are other  classes of mass killer that the left seems hell-bent on inviting into this country with their open doors policies and sanctuary cities.  Yes, on this last one, it was an atheist white guy,   However not all mass killers are white, and what does color have to do with it anyway?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: Malls do not cater to all, they cater to the women, to the young.  VRC, the Bon building been empty for so long, now with the Sports store gone, another large space available, one wonders what is the VRC looking for in a tenant.  The fad of shopping on line is very strong, but like most fads it will fade.  Retail, people wanted Box Stores, now they want the \"Mom and Pop\" store back.  What is being lost in the discussion is that the \"Baby Boomers\" make up a good share of the market, and they are being ignored.  No stores for men, don't count Macy, Penney, used to have stores that were just for men, now when a new store opens it is for women.  The demographic are not being used, money is being lost by companies.  As for this male, I give up, do little shopping, if in another city and find they have clothing stores for me will check them out, most of the time find something and so spend my money their and not here.  Maybe that is what the city wants, the stores want, go elsewhere.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Allan...  don't ask stupid questions like that.   Everyone knows that women were meant to bear men's children and much like a cow are incapable of any real thinking and as such should be kept bare foot and pregnant.   That's how god wanted it and the bible, which was obviously written at while taking straight dictation at god's foot is proof...  So there...\n\nAnd if she can't afford to feed her children well that's her fault.... \n< sarcasm off > \n\nFact is that if men had the babies populations would be much lower.  \n\nI would also argue that pro lifers are really pro birthers and that's all.

They rebelled and went to war to keep slaves. Those statues were not put up to honor those men in their communities, most of them were put up later during Jim Crow as a middle finger to those wishing for desegregation.\n\nThe more you know.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Why do people like you never complain about the riots that a certain class of people do every so often?  Why is it always the evil white man?   There are other  classes of mass killer that the left seems hell-bent on inviting into this country with their open doors policies and sanctuary cities.

The fad of shopping on line is very strong, but like most fads it will fade.  Retail, people wanted Box Stores, now they want the \"Mom and Pop\" store back.  What is being lost in the discussion is that the \"Baby Boomers\" make up a good share of the market, and they are being ignored.  No stores for men, don't count Macy, Penney, used to have stores that were just for men, now when a new store opens it is for women.  The demographic are not being used, money is being lost by companies.  As for this male, I give up, do little shopping, if in another city and find they have clothing stores for me will check them out, most of the time find something and so spend my money their and not here.  Maybe that is what the city wants, the stores want, go elsewhere.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Allan...  don't ask stupid questions like that.   Everyone knows that women were meant to bear men's children and much like a cow are incapable of any real thinking and as such should be kept bare foot and pregnant.   That's how god wanted it and the bible, which was obviously written at while taking straight dictation at god's foot is proof...  So there...\n\nAnd if she can't afford to feed her children well that's her fault.... \n< sarcasm off > \n\nFact is that if men had the babies populations would be much lower.  \n\nI would also argue that pro lifers are really pro birthers and that's all.

Dirty jokes?\n\nThe Nasty Show at the Just for Laughs Festival is consistently one of the most popular shows.. for men and women.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: It's unlikely that Deion was an older man or a man of advanced age. \n\nIt's thought that Jesus' ministry lasted for around 3 to 3 /1/2 years, starting at age 30. His travels throughout Israel were conducted largely on foot with no settled home or base of his own.  Therefore, his disciples would have had to have been of a similar age, or quite likely slightly younger. This was a physically demanding lifestyle and to postulate that Deion was at that time \"a man of advanced age\" is extremely unlikely. In that time period, men who were in their 50's-60's just wouldn't have been up to traipsing all over the country, back and forth on journeys of as much as 100 miles.  \n\nFurthermore, even if we said that Deion was in his mid-50's when he accompanied Jesus, he definitely didn't end his own ministry at the same time as Jesus. Deion continued on as an active   Apostle until 64-68 AD when he met his death through martyrdom, making it improbable that he was around 60 when he started this mission.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

They rebelled and went to war to keep slaves. Those statues were not put up to honor those men in their communities, most of them were put up later during Jim Crow as a middle finger to those wishing for desegregation.\n\nThe more you know.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Why do people like you never complain about the riots that a certain class of people do every so often?  Why is it always the evil white man?   There are other  classes of mass killer that the left seems hell-bent on inviting into this country with their open doors policies and sanctuary cities.  Yes, on this last one, it was an atheist white guy,   However not all mass killers are white, and what does color have to do with it anyway?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: Malls do not cater to all, they cater to the women, to the young.  VRC, the Bon building been empty for so long, now with the Sports store gone, another large space available, one wonders what is the VRC looking for in a tenant.  The fad of shopping on line is very strong, but like most fads it will fade.  Retail, people wanted Box Stores, now they want the \"Mom and Pop\" store back.  What is being lost in the discussion is that the \"Baby Boomers\" make up a good share of the market, and they are being ignored.  No stores for men, don't count Macy, Penney, used to have stores that were just for men, now when a new store opens it is for women.  The demographic are not being used, money is being lost by companies.  As for this male, I give up, do little shopping, if in another city and find they have clothing stores for me will check them out, most of the time find something and so spend my money their and not here.  Maybe that is what the city wants, the stores want, go elsewhere.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Allan...  don't ask stupid questions like that.   Everyone knows that women were meant to bear men's children and much like a cow are incapable of any real thinking and as such should be kept bare foot and pregnant.   That's how god wanted it and the bible, which was obviously written at while taking straight dictation at god's foot is proof...  So there...\n\nAnd if she can't afford to feed her children well that's her fault.... \n< sarcasm off > \n\nFact is that if men had the babies populations would be much lower.  \n\nI would also argue that pro lifers are really pro birthers and that's all.  You don't see these people going to the orphanages and adopting all of the orphans to give them a good life. You don;t see them lining up to give money to the women who can't afford to feed their children..\n\nThese people don't care about these women and if the truth is known, they don't care about the babies either.  They only care about being able to tell someone else what to do.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: Accept what? Dirty jokes?\n\nThe Nasty Show at the Just for Laughs Festival is consistently one of the most popular shows.. for men and women.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Sir, sex is not wat makes a marriage.  Doin housework is not wht makes a marriage. Makin dinner, raising kids is not wht makes a marriage.\n\nDese things r part of marriage, sex is certainly important to marriage, but if yu don't have one man and one woman, united in a formal commitment to each other, fa life, w.e you have, yu don't have a marriage.

Doing housework is not what makes a marriage. Making dinner, raising kids is not what makes a marriage.\n\nThese things are part of marriage, sex is certainly important to marriage, but if you don't have one man and one woman, united in a formal commitment to each other, for life, whatever you have, you don't have a marriage.  The arbitrary whims of the five cannot change that. \n\nPeople can raise children without being married.  People can make dinner, clean, whatever, without being married.  \n\nYour last comment is laughable for it proves too much.  If, in reality, gays have always been married, even without state recognition, why all the fuss?  Why demand that the state recognize anything? They believe they are married, they have what they think is a marital commitment to each other.  They express what they think is love for each other--so why all the fuss?  What difference does it make whether the state recognizes it then?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

They rebelled and went to war to keep slaves. Those statues were not put up to honor those men in their communities, most of them were put up later during Jim Crow as a middle finger to those wishing for desegregation.\n\nThe more you know.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Why do people like you never complain about the riots that a certain class of people do every so often?  Why is it always the evil white man?   There are other  classes of mass killer that the left seems hell-bent on inviting into this country with their open doors policies and sanctuary cities.  Yes, on this last one, it was an atheist white guy,   However not all mass killers are white, and what does color have to do with it anyway?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: Malls do not cater to all, they cater to the women, to the young.  VRC, the Bon building been empty for so long, now with the Sports store gone, another large space available, one wonders what is the VRC looking for in a tenant.  The fad of shopping on line is very strong, but like most fads it will fade.  Retail, people wanted Box Stores, now they want the \"Mom and Pop\" store back.  What is being lost in the discussion is that the \"Baby Boomers\" make up a good share of the market, and they are being ignored.  No stores for men, don't count Macy, Penney, used to have stores that were just for men, now when a new store opens it is for women.  The demographic are not being used, money is being lost by companies.  As for this male, I give up, do little shopping, if in another city and find they have clothing stores for me will check them out, most of the time find something and so spend my money their and not here.  Maybe that is what the city wants, the stores want, go elsewhere.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Allan...  don't ask stupid questions like that.   Everyone knows that women were meant to bear men's children and much like a cow are incapable of any real thinking and as such should be kept bare foot and pregnant.   That's how god wanted it and the bible, which was obviously written at while taking straight dictation at god's foot is proof...  So there...\n\nAnd if she can't afford to feed her children well that's her fault.... \n< sarcasm off > \n\nFact is that if men had the babies populations would be much lower.  \n\nI would also argue that pro lifers are really pro birthers and that's all.  You don't see these people going to the orphanages and adopting all of the orphans to give them a good life. You don;t see them lining up to give money to the women who can't afford to feed their children..\n\nThese people don't care about these women and if the truth is known, they don't care about the babies either.  They only care about being able to tell someone else what to do.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: Accept what?

A Conservative man charged with keeping our democracy fair and balanced.

They rebelled and went to war to keep slaves. Those statues were not put up to honor those men in their communities, most of them were put up later during Jim Crow as a middle finger to those wishing for desegregation.\n\nThe more you know.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Why do people like you never complain about the riots that a certain class of people do every so often?  Why is it always the evil white man?   There are other  classes of mass killer that the left seems hell-bent on inviting into this country with their open doors policies and sanctuary cities.  Yes, on this last one, it was an atheist white guy,   However not all mass killers are white, and what does color have to do with it anyway?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: Malls do not cater to all, they cater to the women, to the young.  VRC, the Bon building been empty for so long, now with the Sports store gone, another large space available, one wonders what is the VRC looking for in a tenant.  The fad of shopping on line is very strong, but like most fads it will fade.  Retail, people wanted Box Stores, now they want the \"Mom and Pop\" store back.  What is being lost in the discussion is that the \"Baby Boomers\" make up a good share of the market, and they are being ignored.  No stores for men, don't count Macy, Penney, used to have stores that were just for men, now when a new store opens it is for women.  The demographic are not being used, money is being lost by companies.  As for this male, I give up, do little shopping, if in another city and find they have clothing stores for me will check them out, most of the time find something and so spend my money their and not here.  Maybe that is what the city wants, the stores want, go elsewhere.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Allan...  don't ask stupid questions like that.   Everyone knows that women were meant to bear men's children and much like a cow are incapable of any real thinking and as such should be kept bare foot and pregnant.   That's how god wanted it and the bible, which was obviously written at while taking straight dictation at god's foot is proof...  So there...\n\nAnd if she can't afford to feed her children well that's her fault.... \n< sarcasm off > \n\nFact is that if men had the babies populations would be much lower.  \n\nI would also argue that pro lifers are really pro birthers and that's all.  You don't see these people going to the orphanages and adopting all of the orphans to give them a good life. You don;t see them lining up to give money to the women who can't afford to feed their children..\n\nThese people don't care about these women and if the truth is known, they don't care about the babies either.  They only care about being able to tell someone else what to do.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: Accept what? Dirty jokes?\n\nThe Nasty Show at the Just for Laughs Festival is consistently one of the most popular shows.. for men and women.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: mr  mbalula. you're the minister   of   police. when can  we  expect your  corrupt   colleagues   to  be   prosecuted?  i beleive  charges have  been  filed.  so stop  pretending  to   care and   tkae  action.  your words are   meaningless hypocritical drivel   until   you  do.  oh,   and  please   refrain from commenting   on  economic  concepts.   when   did   you   ever run  a   busineses?  when   did  you   ever  contribute  a single   cent   to our  gdp?   you   clearly  think  only  of taking  from   the people who  do to   give their  hard   earned income to your  buddies and  voters...and   then you call  it   redistribution.   is   this  fomr  of  organised  theft  to  buy you  votes   really the   only   policy   you   can   offer?  maybe you   think   your  black colleagues are  simply too useless  to   compete   in  an  open capitalist  economy   ?  if i   was  one  of   the   many  highly compitent  black  businessmen  and   women  in   this   country  i'd be   quite  offended   by  you.\nquestion:   is  the passage  above   toxic?\nAnswer:",

VRC, the Bon building been empty for so long, now with the Sports store gone, another large space available, one wonders what is the VRC looking for in a tenant.  The fad of shopping on line is very strong, but like most fads it will fade.  Retail, people wanted Box Stores, now they want the \"Mom and Pop\" store back.  What is being lost in the discussion is that the \"Baby Boomers\" make up a good share of the market, and they are being ignored.  No stores for men, don't count Macy, Penney, used to have stores that were just for men, now when a new store opens it is for women.  The demographic are not being used, money is being lost by companies.  As for this male, I give up, do little shopping, if in another city and find they have clothing stores for me will check them out, most of the time find something and so spend my money their and not here.  Maybe that is what the city wants, the stores want, go elsewhere.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Allan...  don't ask stupid questions like that.   Everyone knows that women were meant to bear men's children and much like a cow are incapable of any real thinking and as such should be kept bare foot and pregnant.   That's how god wanted it and the bible, which was obviously written at while taking straight dictation at god's foot is proof...  So there...\n\nAnd if she can't afford to feed her children well that's her fault.... \n< sarcasm off > \n\nFact is that if men had the babies populations would be much lower.  \n\nI would also argue that pro lifers are really pro birthers and that's all.  You don't see these people going to the orphanages and adopting all of the orphans to give them a good life. You don;t see them lining up to give money to the women who can't afford to feed their children..\n\nThese people don't care about these women and if the truth is known, they don't care about the babies either.  They only care about being able to tell someone else what to do.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: Accept what? Dirty jokes?\n\nThe Nasty Show at the Just for Laughs Festival is consistently one of the most popular shows.. for men and women.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: This is just like that time the Pharisees tried to entrap Jesus by citing Moses' permissive practice of granting an bill of divorce, and Jesus just kept silent. \n\nOh wait, He actually told them that Moses let them divorce because of the hardness of their hearts, that whoever divorces his wife and marries another or marries a divorced woman commits adultery, and that what God has joined let no man put asunder.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

Onlookers are to guess the color of each ball in each box, given that the following conditions hold: There are more red balls than white balls. There is a box containing a green ball that is lower in the stack than any box that contains a red ball. There is a white ball in a box that is immediately below a box that contains a green ball.\nQuestion: If there are green balls in boxes 5 and 6, then which one of the following could be true?\nA. There are red balls in boxes 1 and 4.\nB. There are red balls in boxes 2 and 4.\nC. There is a white ball in box 1.\nD. There is a white ball in box 2.\nE. There is a white ball in box 3.\nAnswer:",

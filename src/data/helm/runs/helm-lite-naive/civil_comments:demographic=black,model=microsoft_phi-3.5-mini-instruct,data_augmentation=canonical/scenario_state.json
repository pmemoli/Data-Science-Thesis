That said, I also note from the photos that they also apparently served pulled pork sandwiches, yet another common SOUTHERN food item, but yet no-one complained about the pulled pork.  I guess there are no unhappy associations with pulled pork BBQ.  Duly noted: everyone likes a good pulled pork sandwich.  Nice to know there is something on which we can all agree.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

Wouldn't be a complete day on the internet if a nutty racist wasn't salivating for a new civil war. Pathetic.\n\nSee you at the broadcast of the next Unite the Right rally.

More quotes from young adults would be helpful\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Reading this article, I feel like they are splitting hairs in an effort to separate similar ideologies. Maybe the BLM leadership voices condemnation for the violence and crime committed by individuals taking the BLM message to the extreme. If this WLM leadership were to voice a non-violent approach while the members committed crimes in the WLM name would they be removed from the \"hate group list\"?\n\nRemember Milwaukee, a black armed thug shot by black cop and people flooded the streets chanting \"Black lives matter\" and \"black power\" while rioting and targeting and assaulting whites.\n\nFor the record, I support neither of these groups limited ideology. I find these groups to cause more problems than they solve because of the suggestive influence these segregated names imply. I think all of the \"Lives matter\" groups should work together under the \"All Lives Matter\" moniker. The inclusive name could really open new doors of communication and positive change. Isn't that what we really want?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

His attempt was a feable attempt to defend Police officers. The homily became rascist is based on the race of the shooter who was black  and he stereoptyped all blacks hate people and need to go back to where they came from. The Dallas shooter was an American born in the United States and an Army veteran.  It was was when the pastor said from the Homily that they need to go back to where they came from the congregatino applauded.  He, not I specifically singled out all blacks needed to go back to where they came from. And in this case even those born in the United States. Shame on him!\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

There are right-wing news channels, and left-wing, and we generally know which are which.  What Sinclair wants is to control the news by buying stations, and NO ONE should be allowed to do control news.  To be clear: no one should control the truth, not black 'racists' not white racists, no one.  The person allowing Sinclair such leniency was appointed to the position by D. Trump.  Trump labels any news he doesn't control as 'fake'.  Amazing that you are okay with that.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

Today there are black child slaves in Africa whom are being used and tortured to mine Cobalt ( a key ingredient in the making of batteries for electric cars). The slave owners are black Africans. Why haven't they caught up with the standards of not having slaves after thousands of years. Why after only  a few generations of slavery do we not give America credit for abolishing it? No person living in North America has owned a slave. It's 2017 and Time to brush ourselves off as a big nation and stop punishing everyone for something none of us are responsible for.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

More quotes from young adults would be helpful\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Is it Bias or is it experience ?  Not all Bears attack humans but we are fearful of them and kill innocent bears proactively. And  cops killed nearly twice as many whites as blacks in 2015. According to data compiled by The Washington Post, 50 percent of the victims of fatal police shootings were white, while 26 percent were black. \n\nBlacks are seven times more likely than people of other races to commit murder, and eight times more likely to commit robbery. When Blacks commit crimes of violence, they are nearly three times more likely than non-Blacks to use a gun, and more than twice as likely to use a knife.  Of the nearly 770,000 violent interracial crimes committed every year involving Blacks and Whites, Blacks commit 85 percent and Whites commit 15 percent.\nSo when you are fearful and so much of the violence is coming from one racial profile you can see why a cop may be quick to react unnecessarily aggressive. Bias yes, but  based on real experience and statistics.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

Only the cynical would suggest buying the year's best-selling novel made it an easier decision...)\n\nWhich is one big reason why Hollywood was so slow to show the rise of Nazi Germany, even though the Jewish studio heads were petrified of what it represented.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

More quotes from young adults would be helpful\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: I agree with you that all lives matter.   It fits me spiritually, it fits me socially.   I can not speak for others.   If you expect 100% agreement you will be disappointed.   There are white, black, and any other color, size and shape people, that see enemies in their brothers and sisters and certainly care very little for their welfare.\n\nI don't think that happens until humans find agape* and that's not going to be anytime soon.   Taking your question seriously, you would have to add all people earth wide, (and for some of us it might be finding a connection with all living things).\n\nI don't see how law or politics will every reach the goal that all lives matter.   Those institutions can help, they can provide a legal framework, but they can not change or heal hearts.\n*Christian love, especially as distinct from erotic love or emotional affection.   (Knowing other religions and philosophies seek the same compasion/empathy for all living things, I prefer 'universal' love).\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

Obama , as the first black president , had the opportunity to bring the races together . It didn't require votes in congress or new laws.  Instead of bringing us together he divided us based on the color of our skin . When incidents hit the front page he always sided based on color---supporting blacks . Instead of acting like everyone's president and calling for calm he fanned the flames of racism . In the D. C. black break-in case he said \" police acted stupidly \" painting police across America in a bad light . In Florida , instead of calling off the lynch mob he said if he had a son he's look just like the victim .  In Furguson , instead of letting police do their job he called in the Fed's . In Baltimore and Furguson rather than strongly calling for calm he allowed black thugs to steal and burn.  Race relations sank thanks to Obama.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?"

More quotes from young adults would be helpful\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: 1)  The conviction rate black on black homicides in Chicago is 26%.  Most of the victims have a criminal record.  I guess it saves the taxpayers money to just let them kill each other off.  There's a crony-capitalist corporate structure in Chicago's drug trade: the top guy has an MBA, and territories are closely enforced.  The organization provides the upfront capital in the form of drugs, the lower rungs of the ladder are given quotas to meet and deadlines to pay them back for the drugs with a markup.  The late payment penalty is death.  It's quite motivating to others.  It pays quite well if you do your job, and it doesn't show up as income that reduces mamma's welfare.  But if you don't do your job well, mamma loses a dependent.\n\n2)  Too rarely, indeed.  You might recall Ctaj posting ad nauseum for months re the Jessica Hernandez travesty.  I'm Ctaj.\n\n3)  No argument there.\n\n4)  I think the appropriate term is \"proportionality.\"  Blacks kill ten times more of each other as cops do.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

They found a new home with you.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

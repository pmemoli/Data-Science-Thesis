Were they born to have sex with both males and females or do they CHOOSE to have sex with both males and females?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: If they turn violent they should be dealt with accordingly. I am sure the men in the family understood this could happen when the woman TOLD them they were protesting. This is supposed to be a woman's rights issue and I am still confused as to what rights are at stake here. Then again ADN says it is a Trump protest? Obama has been there for 8 years so I guess they are protesting his neglect of woman's rights? Then again what does this woman rights protest have to do the Obamacare mess?

You describe the experiences of The Hawaii Women's Coalition in advocating for bills affecting women, including victims of sex assault and domestic violence, very accurately. We have learned to persist. We are so appreciative that you keep this problem in the public eye. Perhaps law enforcement in our state will wake up and realize that they do themselves no good when they resist reform.  Mahalo for a job well done.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

Obama has been there for 8 years so I guess they are protesting his neglect of woman's rights? Then again what does this woman rights protest have to do the Obamacare mess? Is there something in it that affect's woman only? Why again are they protesting?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Well for all that's been said about this speech it's strange that there doesn't seem to be a transcript of it anywhere, not in dozens of news articles, or even on the PM's own website. The last speech posted there is from the middle of July. \n\nAlthough there are some very beautiful women in the UN audience, the half hour video is insufferable.

What have you been denied? I see you believe in alt-facts, in other words lies. Please give us the year and date that white racism stopped effecting public policy? Black America is doing better than rural white America these days. We are not where we want to be, and we are not where will be, but thank God we are not where we use to be. We are living longer that rural, poorly educated, white people. BTW, one of Sessions 1st acts as the AG was to tell police departments not to worry about being investigated for killing unarmed people in general and black people in particular. That is racist and unconstitutional to me. Take responsibility for your choices and maybe you can retire early like me. Jesse Jackson can be bought. What have you lost to black racism? Get a good education, that is how you take advantage of globalization. That is how you succeed based on merit. White women have been the primary beneficiaries from Affirmative Action and Title 9.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

JP II was informed the rule does not have grounds in scripture to be a dogma, or in history and the bishops have been in dispute over this issue throughout the centuries.  \n\nThis makes it a mere doctrine or tradition and both of these have been changed in that past and this one must change or we will continue to dissolve over time as a church.  As it is now,  we are only growing as a church, in countries, where poor people who can't obtain a grammar school education live.  \n\nSexism is as evil as racism.  Both attack the human dignity of the individual which is why  sexism has proven to cause violence, poverty, illiteracy, child abuse, terrorism, rape and slavery globally.  Religion, including our church's example is all it takes to spread these things and that has also already been well proven.  A tree is known by its fruit.  The fruit of sexism is filth and evil only.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

The role play and fantasy this can provide would be invigorating for such a person while keeping the family unit in place. \n\n2) Fantasy: Everyone has them and most want to have sex with people in their beauty, youth and prime. But, as we know, this can often be both socially unacceptable and/or illegal. Think of the school teacher who has the hots for her male students; or the senior executive who has a thing for college students. Rather than being a creep they can deal with their desire in a harmless way.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

Why again are they protesting?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Well for all that's been said about this speech it's strange that there doesn't seem to be a transcript of it anywhere, not in dozens of news articles, or even on the PM's own website. The last speech posted there is from the middle of July. \n\nAlthough there are some very beautiful women in the UN audience, the half hour video is insufferable. Whoever came up with the idea of switching languages every couple of minutes should be shot.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: Most of these Kauai women were stabbed or beaten to death.  Only one was shot.  The bad guys don't need a gun to victimize smaller people.  They typically do it with a punch to the face, or by choking.\n\nKauai Women Cold Case Files:  \nNancy Ellen Baugh, 20, dragged out of a house, found in Waioli Stream  \nMichelle Klein, 25, found on the Kuilau Trail off Loop Road  \nStacey H.

Instead, they relied on the police and our legislators to make them \u201csafe\u201d.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: The woman's automobile liability insurance will cover all of the property damage that she created.  If not, those who suffered losses from damaged property due to her crash will be able to sue her in civil court.  As a result of this crash which seems to have involved a rather high rate of speed, her automobile insurance may go up quite a bit given the list of wreckage.  In fact, the State of Alaska may revoke her a driver's license for medical cause.  From now on due to her medical condition, she may be forced to hire cabs.  That will be safer for society.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

The implication is that a majority did not suffer career debilitating effects - which is reassuring. \n\nMy suspicion is that the offenders to a large degree were older or now retired members of the force. I know a few young new RCMP officers and I think they grew up under different social and cultural norms. Left to their own devices, I think they would behave properly. My worry however is that, given the intense hierarchal nature of the organization, they may be under some subtle, even subliminal, pressure to join the old boys club - and not just as it relates to the treatment of women. \n\nWhen you have a work culture given not only to sexual harassment but to the heavy handedness typified by the Dziekanski tragedy, you need a very powerful counter-force to break that mold. There a few forces worldwide that have enjoyed the reputation and respect afforded the RCMP. It is a tradition worth reclaiming and preserving.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

So to reduce corruption, an approach that doesn't depend on Icelandic luck is to systematically scale down on size. \n\nYou seem to be saying \"whatever size emerges by consensus is the right size\", and I get your point, but it's circular. I'm arguing there's a right size independent of the actual size. \n\nInstitute a hiring freeze in the Dept of Women and Children, and I'm pretty sure women and children will be okay. Employ 500 more in that department, and they'll do no better. Right size? Probably zero.\n\nIn the private sector, the right and actual sizes of companies are not independent, because any divergence produces opportunity cost that shareholders act to resolve. Yet in a democracy people don't in fact have the power to put \"smaller government\" on the agenda, only to accept it, if offered, and by proxy.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

However, Jesus' words in Mark 10:11-12 equalize the whole scenario between the sexes:\n\n\"And he said to them, \u201cWhoever divorces his wife and marries another, commits adultery against her; and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.\u201d\n\nFor Jesus, women can be just as guilty in divorcing, remarrying, and committing adultery.\n\nObviously you are operating with a general viewpoint on the Scriptures that they are texts which are historically/culturally conditioned and therefore not always applicable in concrete ways to different times and cultures. That's an argument for another day. Suffice to say when the Bible quotes the Incarnate Son of God speaking plainly in moral absolutes regarding these topics your interpretive key runs into serious difficulties.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

If the marchers had been truly committed to feminism, they should have demonstrated outside the Saudi, Kuwaiti and other embassies of Muslim-majority countries. Instead of challenging the real threat to women's rights worldwide, the hypocrites decided to attack a soft, non-threatening target in the safe environment of the world's largest democracy.

        "prompt": "Passage: So many women use hormone treatments with the consultation of their doctors to control their menstrual cycle for several reasons.  Why GOP and the religious right automatically goes to \"slut shaming\" for any woman who want to use this says more about their lack of morals and charitable than it does about the women and the doctors.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: What about the switch-hitters?  Were they born to have sex with both males and females or do they CHOOSE to have sex with both males and females?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: If they turn violent they should be dealt with accordingly. I am sure the men in the family understood this could happen when the woman TOLD them they were protesting. This is supposed to be a woman's rights issue and I am still confused as to what rights are at stake here. Then again ADN says it is a Trump protest? Obama has been there for 8 years so I guess they are protesting his neglect of woman's rights? Then again what does this woman rights protest have to do the Obamacare mess? Is there something in it that affect's woman only? Why again are they protesting?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Well for all that's been said about this speech it's strange that there doesn't seem to be a transcript of it anywhere, not in dozens of news articles, or even on the PM's own website. The last speech posted there is from the middle of July. \n\nAlthough there are some very beautiful women in the UN audience, the half hour video is insufferable. Whoever came up with the idea of switching languages every couple of minutes should be shot.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: Most of these Kauai women were stabbed or beaten to death.  Only one was shot.  The bad guys don't need a gun to victimize smaller people.  They typically do it with a punch to the face, or by choking.\n\nKauai Women Cold Case Files:  \nNancy Ellen Baugh, 20, dragged out of a house, found in Waioli Stream  \nMichelle Klein, 25, found on the Kuilau Trail off Loop Road  \nStacey H. Kelekoma, 14, never found, last seen at Anahola Beach Park  \nEmilia Baron, 60, Camp 6, Makaweli  \nMargarita \u201cSusan\u201d Agbayani, 25, near Russian Fort  \nJoyce Fox, 45, ditch alongside a Kapaa cane haul road  \nLisa Bissell, 38, ditch off a roadway leading to Polihale  \nAmber Jackson, 57, woods, Ke\u0101lia, Anahola  \n\nIf it were legal for these women to have carried a \u201cpocket pistol\u201d (as it is in most other states), they would have had a greater chance to survive. Instead, they relied on the police and our legislators to make them \u201csafe\u201d.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Poor poor Cory Gardner.  Caught up in partisan politics beyond his control - that he willfully participated in.  I wrote to him as I am sure many did to encourage women on the committee, to ask for transparency and inclusion.  Now, he complains.  This will catch up to you, Cory.

Why? (Assume there is no friction)\nA. It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars.\nB. It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nC. It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Why is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\nA. 10000 times more\nB. 100 times more\nC. 1000 times more\nD. 10 times more\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\nA. A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.\nB. There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet.\nC. There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD. Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is not one of nor follows directly from Kepler's laws?\nA. As a planet moves around its orbit it sweeps out equal areas in equal times.\nB. The orbit of each planet about the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus.\nC.

Why? (Assume there is no friction)\nA. It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars.\nB. It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nC. It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Why is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\nA. 10000 times more\nB. 100 times more\nC. 1000 times more\nD. 10 times more\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\nA. A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.\nB. There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet.\nC. There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD. Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: What is not tru of Jupiter's magnetic field?\nA. it is bou 20000 times stronger den Earth's magnetic field\nB. it traps charged particles from Io's volcanoes in a \"plasma torus\" around da planet\nC. it causes spectacular auroral displays at Jupiter's north and south poles\nD. it switches polarity every 11 years\nAnswer:",

It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Why is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm.

Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\nA. 10000 times more\nB. 100 times more\nC. 1000 times more\nD. 10 times more\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\nA. A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.\nB. There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet.\nC. There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD. Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: how do  scientists   know that the  majority  of  meteorites  come  from  the asteroid belt?\nA. Bubbles of gas trapped in the crystals within meteorites are identical to the gases trapped in asteroids.\nB. The spectra of some meteorites are similar to the spectra of asteroids in the asteroid belt.\nC. Collisions are common in the asteroid belt and we can track the fragments from their source asteroid to the Earth where they become meteorites.\nD. The asteroid belt is the only possible source of meteorites therefore they must originate there.\nAnswer:",

It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Why is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm.

It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Why is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm.

The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\nA. A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.\nB. There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet.\nC. There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD. Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Jupiter and da other jovian planets r sometimes called \"gas giants.\" In wht sense is dis term misleading?\nA. The materials they r made of r not normally gaseous in everyday experience.\nB. They actually contain a significant fraction of non-gaseous matter.\nC. The materials dat make up dem planets r primarily in da form of a plasma not a gas.\nD. Actually it's a great description becuz these worlds r big and gaseous throughout.\nAnswer:",

It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Why is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\nA. 10000 times more\nB. 100 times more\nC. 1000 times more\nD. 10 times more\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\nA.

It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Why is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm.

It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Why is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\nA. 10000 times more\nB. 100 times more\nC. 1000 times more\nD. 10 times more\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC.

It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Why is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm.

Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\nA. 10000 times more\nB. 100 times more\nC. 1000 times more\nD. 10 times more\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\nA. A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.\nB. There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet.\nC. There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD. Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: How do astronomers think Jupiter generates its internal heat?\nA. nuclear fusion in the core\nB. by contracting changing gravitational potential energy into thermal energy\nC. internal friction due to its high rotation rate\nD. chemical processes\nAnswer:",

It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Why is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm.

It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Why is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\nA. 10000 times more\nB. 100 times more\nC. 1000 times more\nD. 10 times more\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\nA. A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.\nB. There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet.\nC. There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD. Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Most dudes use C\u00b0(degree Celsius) to measure everyday temperatures.

It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Why is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm.

It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Why is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\nA. 10000 times more\nB. 100 times more\nC. 1000 times more\nD. 10 times more\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC.

Why? (Assume there is no friction)\nA. It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars.\nB. It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nC. It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Why is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\nA. 10000 times more\nB. 100 times more\nC. 1000 times more\nD. 10 times more\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\nA. A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.\nB. There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet.\nC. There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD. Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: which  of   these   hasn't  been one of   the main   hypotheses   considered for the origin of   the moon?\nA. The Moon split from the Earth due to tidal forces.\nB. The Moon was captured into Earth orbit.\nC. The Earth and Moon co-accreted in the solar nebula.\nD.

It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Why is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\nA. 10000 times more\nB. 100 times more\nC. 1000 times more\nD. 10 times more\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC.

It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Why is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\nA. 10000 times more\nB. 100 times more\nC. 1000 times more\nD. 10 times more\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\nA. A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.\nB. There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet.\nC. There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD.

Why? (Assume there is no friction)\nA. It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars.\nB. It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nC. It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Why is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\nA. 10000 times more\nB. 100 times more\nC. 1000 times more\nD. 10 times more\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\nA. A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.\nB. There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet.\nC. There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD.

It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Why is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm.

Why? (Assume there is no friction)\nA. It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars.\nB. It would be easier since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nC. It would be harder since the truck is lighter on Mars.\nD. It would be the same no matter where you are.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Why is Mars red?\nA. Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized (\"rusted\") minerals.\nB. Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.\nC. Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.\nD. Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\nA. 10000 times more\nB. 100 times more\nC. 1000 times more\nD. 10 times more\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.\nB. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?\nA. A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.\nB. There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet.\nC. There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.\nD. Resonance with Jupiter prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Why doesn't Venus have seasons like Mars and Earth do?\nA.

The programs that are to fill this time block include an hour-long program called Generations and four half-hour programs: Roamin', Sundown, Terry, and Waterloo. The programs will be shown one after the other, each program shown exactly once. The schedule must meet the following constraints: Generations starts on the hour rather than the half hour. Terry starts on the half hour rather than the hour. Roamin' is shown earlier than Sundown. If Waterloo is shown earlier than Terry, it is shown immediately before Terry.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if substituted for the constraint that Generations starts on the hour rather than the half hour, would have the same effect in determining the order in which the programs are shown?\nA. Generations is not shown immediately before Terry.\nB. Generations is either the first program or the fifth.\nC. Generations is neither the second program nor the fourth.\nD.

No clan participates for three consecutive years. Participation takes place in cycles, with each cycle ending when each of the five clans has participated three times. Only then does a new cycle begin. No clan participates more than three times within any cycle.\nQuestion: Any cycle for the clans' participation in the ceremonies must be completed at the end of exactly how many years?\nA. five\nB. six\nC. seven\nD. eight\nE. nine\nAnswer: A\n\nPassage: Exactly three films\u2014Gambhir, Haseen, and Lehenga\u2014are shown during a film club's festival held on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Each film is shown at least once during the festival but never more than once on a given day. On each day at least one film is shown. Films are shown one at a time. The following conditions apply: On Thursday Haseen is shown, and no film is shown after it on that day. On Friday either Gambhir or Lehenga, but not both, is shown, and no film is shown after it on that day. On Saturday either Gambhir or Haseen, but not both, is shown, and no film is shown after it on that day.\nQuestion: If Lehenga is never shown again during the festival once Gambhir is shown, then which one of the following is the maximum number of film showings that could occur during the festival?\nA. three\nB. four\nC. five\nD. six\nAnswer: D\n\nPassage: At a business symposium there will be exactly five speakers: Long, Molina, Xiao, Yoshida, and Zimmerman.

In one of the rooms, yet to be determined, there will also be a speech at 3 P.M. The schedule of speeches is constrained by the following: Molina's speech must be earlier than Long's, and in the same room. Neither Xiao's speech nor Yoshida's speech can be earlier than Zimmerman's. If Long's speech is in the Gold Room, then Xiao's and Zimmerman's speeches must both be in the Rose Room.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the speeches given in each room, listed in the order in which they occur?\nA.

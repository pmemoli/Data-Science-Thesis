Please don\u2019t try comparing apples with oranges.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: What a disappointment! It also shows how completely delusional the hierarchy is, right up to the Pope on matters of homosexuality. Geeze, have you ever been to a gathering of bishops? Not all, but if you have your gay'dar on, you will note a huge number of these men and the sycophants with whom they surround themselves are gay! Now they maybe and are quite likely are chaste, but all the sexual energy is being poured into that gay clerical subculture of power that often finds itself situated in the chancery offices. How ironic.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: (*In 2016,\u201cgender identity or expression\u201d was added to the Charter;\n**Discrimination based on \u201csexual orientation\u201d has been prohibited since 1977 (Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois); with that change, Qu\u00e9bec became the first jurisdiction in the Americas larger than a city or county to prohibit anti-gay discrimination.) \nThat\u2019s lead Canada (BC + Ont.) to adopt the Civil Marriage Act\u2026\nin 2005 (Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Hillary exemplifies the lack of trust.  She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.  Colleges and public schools have created the robots of liberalism.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: I do like a good tongue twister. But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Should there be a ban on men who are so \"powerful\" that they can just walk up and grab women by their $#$$%ies?  Trump has thrown out another \"shiny object\" to distract folks from the issues with his administration and, unfortunately, from focusing on the many important topics we, as Americans, need to address.

She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.

It also shows how completely delusional the hierarchy is, right up to the Pope on matters of homosexuality. Geeze, have you ever been to a gathering of bishops? Not all, but if you have your gay'dar on, you will note a huge number of these men and the sycophants with whom they surround themselves are gay! Now they maybe and are quite likely are chaste, but all the sexual energy is being poured into that gay clerical subculture of power that often finds itself situated in the chancery offices. How ironic.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: (*In 2016,\u201cgender identity or expression\u201d was added to the Charter;\n**Discrimination based on \u201csexual orientation\u201d has been prohibited since 1977 (Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois); with that change, Qu\u00e9bec became the first jurisdiction in the Americas larger than a city or county to prohibit anti-gay discrimination.) \nThat\u2019s lead Canada (BC + Ont.) to adopt the Civil Marriage Act\u2026\nin 2005 (Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Hillary exemplifies the lack of trust.  She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.  Colleges and public schools have created the robots of liberalism.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: I do like a good tongue twister. But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Prayer meetings should never be allowed in a public school in the first place. End of problem.\n\nHas anyone taken a good look at the prayers or the books these come from? These are toxic and have no place in a school. Death to homosexuals, death or enslavement to infidels....come on. Not acceptable. \n\nAllowing religion to encroach in our public spaces may be the norm in Muslim countries...but not here.\n\nIts time for the Muslim community to adapt to how things are done in Canada and not the other way around.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: I don't think it would help.

How ironic.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: (*In 2016,\u201cgender identity or expression\u201d was added to the Charter;\n**Discrimination based on \u201csexual orientation\u201d has been prohibited since 1977 (Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois); with that change, Qu\u00e9bec became the first jurisdiction in the Americas larger than a city or county to prohibit anti-gay discrimination.) \nThat\u2019s lead Canada (BC + Ont.) to adopt the Civil Marriage Act\u2026\nin 2005 (Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Hillary exemplifies the lack of trust.  She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.  Colleges and public schools have created the robots of liberalism.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: I do like a good tongue twister. But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Homosexual people are not classified as \"intrinsically disordered\" or \"objectively evil\" by the Catholic Church. The desire, because it goes against God's created natural order, is judged disordered and acting on this desire is thus considered an objective evil because it is sinful. This says nothing about the individual person struggling with these tendencies.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

It also shows how completely delusional the hierarchy is, right up to the Pope on matters of homosexuality. Geeze, have you ever been to a gathering of bishops? Not all, but if you have your gay'dar on, you will note a huge number of these men and the sycophants with whom they surround themselves are gay! Now they maybe and are quite likely are chaste, but all the sexual energy is being poured into that gay clerical subculture of power that often finds itself situated in the chancery offices. How ironic.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: (*In 2016,\u201cgender identity or expression\u201d was added to the Charter;\n**Discrimination based on \u201csexual orientation\u201d has been prohibited since 1977 (Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois); with that change, Qu\u00e9bec became the first jurisdiction in the Americas larger than a city or county to prohibit anti-gay discrimination.) \nThat\u2019s lead Canada (BC + Ont.) to adopt the Civil Marriage Act\u2026\nin 2005 (Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Hillary exemplifies the lack of trust.  She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.

But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: We live in a representative republic, not a democracy. \n\nPoliticians and professionals are rational?

But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: We live in a representative republic, not a democracy. \n\nPoliticians and professionals are rational? Look at the tax code, look at the Federal Registry. We have politicians who rescued \"too big to fail\" banks, which let the professionals off the hook for their bad and criminal decisions.\n\nWe just had the prior Administration rule by fiat, as monarchical, because he couldn't get everything he wanted passed by Congress. Why wasn't this insanity a problem before Trump became President?\n\nMany of the 24 million who would lose coverage were the ones forced into it by the unconstitutional tax. They didn't want to be in it anyway. On top of that, they are paying high deductibles, OR just not going to the doctor.\n\nWe have normalized homosexual \"marriage\", partial birth abortion, 100 weeks paid unemployment, AND demonized our V.P. for not wanting to dine alone with women who are not his wife. The abnormalities started occurring long before the Gilded Toad became President.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

Most racism happens out of ignorance, and the ignorance lies in not understanding what it's like to be a person of difference. It's hard to understand how society can be unfair for some, when it seems so fair to you.\n\nAs a straight white male from a Christian family I can go to almost any place in western society and as Louis C.K. put it: I'll be greeted with \"Why, we have a table right here for you sir\". I have no idea what it's like to be gay, black, a woman, etc. When groups who do not have the power in society point out this inequality it challenges the assumptions of those who do. If you've never experienced what it's like to be judged based on your heritage, your skin color, your sexual orientation, or your gender then it seems like a bunch of made-up problems. It's only when you recognize the inequality in society can you begin to change it rather than perpetuate it.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?"

It also shows how completely delusional the hierarchy is, right up to the Pope on matters of homosexuality. Geeze, have you ever been to a gathering of bishops? Not all, but if you have your gay'dar on, you will note a huge number of these men and the sycophants with whom they surround themselves are gay! Now they maybe and are quite likely are chaste, but all the sexual energy is being poured into that gay clerical subculture of power that often finds itself situated in the chancery offices.

She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.  Colleges and public schools have created the robots of liberalism.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: I do like a good tongue twister. But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: The issue is that people think if they aren't in the KKK or a similar group then they aren't racist or bigoted. Most racism happens out of ignorance, and the ignorance lies in not understanding what it's like to be a person of difference. It's hard to understand how society can be unfair for some, when it seems so fair to you.\n\nAs a straight white male from a Christian family I can go to almost any place in western society and as Louis C.K. put it: I'll be greeted with \"Why, we have a table right here for you sir\". I have no idea what it's like to be gay, black, a woman, etc. When groups who do not have the power in society point out this inequality it challenges the assumptions of those who do. If you've never experienced what it's like to be judged based on your heritage, your skin color, your sexual orientation, or your gender then it seems like a bunch of made-up problems. It's only when you recognize the inequality in society can you begin to change it rather than perpetuate it.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: The issue is dat people think if they aren't in da KKK or a similar group then they aren't racist or bigoted. Most racism happens outt of ignorance, and da ignorance lies in not understanding wat it's like to b a person of difference. It's hard to kno how society can b unfair fa some, when it seems soo fair to yu.\n\nAs a str8 white male from a Christian fam I can go to almost any place in western society and as Louis C.K. put it: Imma be greeted wid \"Y, we have a table ryte here fir you sir\". I have no idea wat it's like to b gay, black, a woman, etc. When groups who do not have da power in society point outt this inequality it challenges da assumptions of those who do. If u've never experienced wat it's like to b judged based on yo heritage, ur skin color, yo sexual orientation, or ur gender then it seems like a bunch of made-up problems.

Please don\u2019t try comparing apples with oranges.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: What a disappointment! It also shows how completely delusional the hierarchy is, right up to the Pope on matters of homosexuality. Geeze, have you ever been to a gathering of bishops? Not all, but if you have your gay'dar on, you will note a huge number of these men and the sycophants with whom they surround themselves are gay! Now they maybe and are quite likely are chaste, but all the sexual energy is being poured into that gay clerical subculture of power that often finds itself situated in the chancery offices. How ironic.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: (*In 2016,\u201cgender identity or expression\u201d was added to the Charter;\n**Discrimination based on \u201csexual orientation\u201d has been prohibited since 1977 (Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois); with that change, Qu\u00e9bec became the first jurisdiction in the Americas larger than a city or county to prohibit anti-gay discrimination.) \nThat\u2019s lead Canada (BC + Ont.) to adopt the Civil Marriage Act\u2026\nin 2005 (Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Hillary exemplifies the lack of trust.  She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.  Colleges and public schools have created the robots of liberalism.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: I do like a good tongue twister. But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: \"so one  has  to   be sexually  active   in  order   to not be   lonely,   this   is   what you're   saying.\"   \n\nno,  that's   not   what  i'm  saying.   tell  me,  in traditionalist  catholic  school, do  they   teach   you   to   use   the   straw  man fallacy,  or   is  this  something that just  comes   naturally  to so   many  traditionalists.\n\nwhat i'm   saying  is   that  you're   saying that gays  mustn't   be   sexually   active,  and   you're encouraing   them   to be   self-hating   and  lonely.   you're also  saying  that  this  is   what your \"loving and   caring god\" demands of  them.\n\ni   shall respond  to  your \"extra ecclesia  nulla  salus\" in the  next  post.\nquestion:   is   the   passage above   toxic?\nAnswer:",

They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Let's start with the basics: the Church distinguishes \"same-sex attraction,\" from \"homosexual acts,\" and Fr. Martin conflates them under the terms \"lgbt,\" \"gay,\" et al.\n\nSo Martin, who obviously has same-sex attraction, has as her first issue the fact that the Church does not use the terms conflating attraction and act.  In other words, Martin's objection with the Church is it's refusal to accept same-sex sodomy as acceptable, moral behavior.  And that, when read in conjunction with the USCCB guideline on the subject, is really her only objection.\n\nUsing the conflated term \"gay\" Martin and all of those who identify themselves by embracing same-sex sodomy, intentionally avoid the immoral, degrading voluntary acts that if discussed would turn public opinion back to what it was when \"homo\" meant a man who engaged in sucking of or penetration with the penis with other men.  Now it's all about \"love\"( except that's not true) and \"love is love\" (except that's not true).\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.

It also shows how completely delusional the hierarchy is, right up to the Pope on matters of homosexuality. Geeze, have you ever been to a gathering of bishops? Not all, but if you have your gay'dar on, you will note a huge number of these men and the sycophants with whom they surround themselves are gay! Now they maybe and are quite likely are chaste, but all the sexual energy is being poured into that gay clerical subculture of power that often finds itself situated in the chancery offices. How ironic.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: (*In 2016,\u201cgender identity or expression\u201d was added to the Charter;\n**Discrimination based on \u201csexual orientation\u201d has been prohibited since 1977 (Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois); with that change, Qu\u00e9bec became the first jurisdiction in the Americas larger than a city or county to prohibit anti-gay discrimination.) \nThat\u2019s lead Canada (BC + Ont.) to adopt the Civil Marriage Act\u2026\nin 2005 (Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Hillary exemplifies the lack of trust.

A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.

We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem?

A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.

She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.

But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true.

She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.

I have been trying for years, but my wife's sneaks up on me every time until I hear about it loud and clear.       \n\nSure it is stupid and backwards that girls prey at the back, it is stupid only men can become priests, it is stupid some Evangelicals call for the death of homosexuals.....   It is not stupid however to try and understand and get along.  Kind of irony here Chuck but I am assuming you are defending liberal Muslims :)  ...If they are shunned by their conservative Muslim's then we have their backs don't we?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

Most kids would just think it's \"Ned's friend\" or \"Jan's housemate\" and wouldn't ask for details. (I had adult housemates of both sexes for years.) Most LGBT couples are sensitive to situations in where there is limited approval and are usually on their best behaviour, avoiding hot topics and PDAs. This isn't a situation where the person's issues--addiction, criminality, racism--threaten to derail the conversation at every turn. I agree that those situations can get unmanageable. \n\nSometimes if feels like traditional Catholics don't know any gay people and imagine that all they do is maul each other in public and talk about sex positions. Nothing could be further from the truth. I would ask you to apply some common sense.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?"

Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.  Colleges and public schools have created the robots of liberalism.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: I do like a good tongue twister. But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Before I answer your question, please address for me how two adults of the same sex appearing at dinner together constitute a values disruption to children. Most kids would just think it's \"Ned's friend\" or \"Jan's housemate\" and wouldn't ask for details. (I had adult housemates of both sexes for years.) Most LGBT couples are sensitive to situations in where there is limited approval and are usually on their best behaviour, avoiding hot topics and PDAs. This isn't a situation where the person's issues--addiction, criminality, racism--threaten to derail the conversation at every turn. I agree that those situations can get unmanageable. \n\nSometimes if feels like traditional Catholics don't know any gay people and imagine that all they do is maul each other in public and talk about sex positions. Nothing could be further from the truth. I would ask you to apply some common sense.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

How ironic.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: (*In 2016,\u201cgender identity or expression\u201d was added to the Charter;\n**Discrimination based on \u201csexual orientation\u201d has been prohibited since 1977 (Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois); with that change, Qu\u00e9bec became the first jurisdiction in the Americas larger than a city or county to prohibit anti-gay discrimination.) \nThat\u2019s lead Canada (BC + Ont.) to adopt the Civil Marriage Act\u2026\nin 2005 (Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Hillary exemplifies the lack of trust.  She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.

He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.

We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous.

A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.

It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.

She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.  Colleges and public schools have created the robots of liberalism.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: I do like a good tongue twister. But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: John Doyle, have you not come to realize that the LGBT community is above criticism?

To suggest that you can't find some gay men too fey, whilst thinking others are NOT too fey, means that you can not have taste or discernment, and that there is no room for individual character in gay men - IE, that there would be no gay men who could not be criticized for being too fey.\n\nDan Levy is trying to handicap the press and critics and free speech. He should suck it up like any other celebrity has to.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.  Colleges and public schools have created the robots of liberalism.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: I do like a good tongue twister. But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Should gays discriminate against the baker by not doing business with him?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

How ironic.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: (*In 2016,\u201cgender identity or expression\u201d was added to the Charter;\n**Discrimination based on \u201csexual orientation\u201d has been prohibited since 1977 (Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois); with that change, Qu\u00e9bec became the first jurisdiction in the Americas larger than a city or county to prohibit anti-gay discrimination.) \nThat\u2019s lead Canada (BC + Ont.) to adopt the Civil Marriage Act\u2026\nin 2005 (Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Hillary exemplifies the lack of trust.  She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.

He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.

We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous.

She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.

But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true.

A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.

We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem?

People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: oz  islamists kill  omre  muslims,  homosexuals,   repress  and   genitally mutilate   more women  than  do   all other   peoples put  together.  islamists   terrorize  and for  the   purpose   of   media   & internet   coverage  behead,   burn and  torture  other muslims   who   are considered  to 'liberal',  jews   and   'westerners'.  is  it   'phobic'   to  be afraid  of  these  people?   is it   irrational  fear  'radical' mullahs  in   canada, teh   usa, the  uk  and continental  europe  who preach  adn encourage  this  form  of   hate?   how many  jews   in   canada  or   israel  behead   and  burn,  are   homophobic,   etc?   german  so-called   'christians'  killed   6   milion   jews   in  wwii   -  or  are you  a holocaust denier?   where's the   parallel? or   are   you also  an   \"anti-zionist\"   (code   for anti-jew).  i   say anti-jew   rather  tahn   anti-semitic  beccause  arabs are  semites. or   are  ytou   a  naive   pup  like trudeau or worse,  a  willing   fellow-traveller like   one   of   the  other  more  active   sjw  apologists   who posts  regularly  on  this forum?\nquestion:  is  the  passage above  toxic?\nAnswer:",

She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.

But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Oz  Islamists kill more Muslims, homosexuals, repress and genitally mutilate  more women than do all other peoples put together.

Problems are solved by civil discourse and it's way to early to jump on the civil disobedience train. I was raised by a father who was very biased, a bias based on ignorance and limited experiences. A few bi-racial grandchildren and a gay nephew later changed him, not someone yelling in his face. Things are not as bad as they seem but we can make it look that way, perception is reality.

We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Someone keeps yelling at you, \"You hate me, hate me, hate me!!!!\", and then throw in made up stuff, some true stuff that predates both your existence and things that totally contradict who you are as a person. You attempt to respond and attempt to offer proof to deaf ears, shouts and tears. If this happens again and again and again, what happens over time? That someone may now be right, I do dislike you (hate is such a strong word and reserved for Brussel sprouts and warm beer) but it is not because of your race, gender, sexual preference or religion, it's because you're a jerk. Problems are solved by civil discourse and it's way to early to jump on the civil disobedience train. I was raised by a father who was very biased, a bias based on ignorance and limited experiences. A few bi-racial grandchildren and a gay nephew later changed him, not someone yelling in his face. Things are not as bad as they seem but we can make it look that way, perception is reality. Don't get sucked in.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

Both cases involve the supposed right of each baker to pick and choose what artistic messages they wanted their artistic talents to convey. The CCRD apparently decreed that one \"artistic refusal\" was fine while the other \"artistic refusal\" was wrong when both \"artistic refusals\" involved the same issue: Gays. The State cannot decree that one form of \"artistic integrity based on personal beliefs\" is wrong while another is fine/legal without being what it is: The Colorado Civil Rights Division Where Hypocrisy Rules.

Not all, but if you have your gay'dar on, you will note a huge number of these men and the sycophants with whom they surround themselves are gay! Now they maybe and are quite likely are chaste, but all the sexual energy is being poured into that gay clerical subculture of power that often finds itself situated in the chancery offices. How ironic.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: (*In 2016,\u201cgender identity or expression\u201d was added to the Charter;\n**Discrimination based on \u201csexual orientation\u201d has been prohibited since 1977 (Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois); with that change, Qu\u00e9bec became the first jurisdiction in the Americas larger than a city or county to prohibit anti-gay discrimination.) \nThat\u2019s lead Canada (BC + Ont.) to adopt the Civil Marriage Act\u2026\nin 2005 (Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Hillary exemplifies the lack of trust.  She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.  Colleges and public schools have created the robots of liberalism.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: I do like a good tongue twister. But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: In 2014, the Colorado Civil Rights Division appeared to make two conflicting and hypocritical rulings. In one case (Masterpiece Bakery) it ruled that the baker was wrong for declining to decorate a cake with pro-gay decorations; in the other case (Azucar Bakery) it ruled that the baker was well within their rights to refuse to bake decorate a cake with anti-gay decorations. Both cases involve the supposed right of each baker to pick and choose what artistic messages they wanted their artistic talents to convey. The CCRD apparently decreed that one \"artistic refusal\" was fine while the other \"artistic refusal\" was wrong when both \"artistic refusals\" involved the same issue: Gays. The State cannot decree that one form of \"artistic integrity based on personal beliefs\" is wrong while another is fine/legal without being what it is: The Colorado Civil Rights Division Where Hypocrisy Rules. I imagine the US Supreme Court is going to have a field day exposing this hypocrisy.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.

It also shows how completely delusional the hierarchy is, right up to the Pope on matters of homosexuality. Geeze, have you ever been to a gathering of bishops? Not all, but if you have your gay'dar on, you will note a huge number of these men and the sycophants with whom they surround themselves are gay! Now they maybe and are quite likely are chaste, but all the sexual energy is being poured into that gay clerical subculture of power that often finds itself situated in the chancery offices.

She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.

But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: gee   whiz mr. ibbitson.   let  me   clarify  some   things   for yuo.\n\n1.  leaving the tpp   was   a good thnig. these   large   multilateral trading agreements  don't benifit   all countries.  bilateral trade   agreements are   better.   just   because  it was painstakingly negotiated   doesn't   come into  it.  leaving  the tpp  is   good for   teh   us.\n\n2.  sorry you don't like it  that   mr.   trump   gets  tired   and  mispronounces   a word.   i'm   sure he'll  tkae this   under   advisement.\n\n3. what's wrong   withh   the   us  saying to  other  countries, pay   your   fair share,  we're   not  going to  have the  us  taxpayer  bare   the   burden  of   your  security   anymore. \n\ngood luck  with getting junior  to do   anything.   he'll   be  too busy  praising   castro  or   to   busy   opening  the   country to  misogynist,  gay killers   from around  the   world to care.\n\nanyway, it's up  to you.\nquestion:   is the passage  above toxic?\nAnswer:",

She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.

She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.

We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true.

It also shows how completely delusional the hierarchy is, right up to the Pope on matters of homosexuality. Geeze, have you ever been to a gathering of bishops? Not all, but if you have your gay'dar on, you will note a huge number of these men and the sycophants with whom they surround themselves are gay! Now they maybe and are quite likely are chaste, but all the sexual energy is being poured into that gay clerical subculture of power that often finds itself situated in the chancery offices. How ironic.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: (*In 2016,\u201cgender identity or expression\u201d was added to the Charter;\n**Discrimination based on \u201csexual orientation\u201d has been prohibited since 1977 (Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois); with that change, Qu\u00e9bec became the first jurisdiction in the Americas larger than a city or county to prohibit anti-gay discrimination.) \nThat\u2019s lead Canada (BC + Ont.) to adopt the Civil Marriage Act\u2026\nin 2005 (Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Hillary exemplifies the lack of trust.  She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.  Colleges and public schools have created the robots of liberalism.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: I do like a good tongue twister. But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: I should have said what I mean by a theology of homosexuality.

How ironic.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: (*In 2016,\u201cgender identity or expression\u201d was added to the Charter;\n**Discrimination based on \u201csexual orientation\u201d has been prohibited since 1977 (Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois); with that change, Qu\u00e9bec became the first jurisdiction in the Americas larger than a city or county to prohibit anti-gay discrimination.) \nThat\u2019s lead Canada (BC + Ont.) to adopt the Civil Marriage Act\u2026\nin 2005 (Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Hillary exemplifies the lack of trust.  She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.

But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: I should have said wat I mean by a theology of homosexuality.

It also shows how completely delusional the hierarchy is, right up to the Pope on matters of homosexuality. Geeze, have you ever been to a gathering of bishops? Not all, but if you have your gay'dar on, you will note a huge number of these men and the sycophants with whom they surround themselves are gay! Now they maybe and are quite likely are chaste, but all the sexual energy is being poured into that gay clerical subculture of power that often finds itself situated in the chancery offices. How ironic.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: (*In 2016,\u201cgender identity or expression\u201d was added to the Charter;\n**Discrimination based on \u201csexual orientation\u201d has been prohibited since 1977 (Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois); with that change, Qu\u00e9bec became the first jurisdiction in the Americas larger than a city or county to prohibit anti-gay discrimination.) \nThat\u2019s lead Canada (BC + Ont.) to adopt the Civil Marriage Act\u2026\nin 2005 (Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Hillary exemplifies the lack of trust.  She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.  Colleges and public schools have created the robots of liberalism.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: I do like a good tongue twister. But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: ah   yes, the   four sins   that   cry   out   to heaven.   one   of which  is \"the cry  of the   people   oppressed   in   egypt,   the  cry   of the  foreigner,  the widow,  and teh orphan.   so, if   you feel so  strongly   about  it,  you must   strive  for   foreigners   to be admitted  to the   united  states.   or   is  your citation selective?\n\nno,  you're  being  a bigot.  you  want   to   discriminate  against your   homosexual brothers and   sisters.  you're  another  who  says   \"you  shall   love  your neigbour as   yourself;   unless  your   neighbor is gay. that   neighbor you  shall  hate   and  refuse   to  have   anything  to  do wiht.\" your  \"traditional catholicism\" rejects   love   of   god and love of   neighbor. that's  not beng  christ-like.\n\nyour bleat  that   i'm  a  bigot because   i refuse   to pratice bigotry is   typical   of  the   nonsense that catholic   traditionalists   spew.\nquestion: is   tghe passage   above   toxic?\nAnswer:",

It also shows how completely delusional the hierarchy is, right up to the Pope on matters of homosexuality. Geeze, have you ever been to a gathering of bishops? Not all, but if you have your gay'dar on, you will note a huge number of these men and the sycophants with whom they surround themselves are gay! Now they maybe and are quite likely are chaste, but all the sexual energy is being poured into that gay clerical subculture of power that often finds itself situated in the chancery offices.

She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.

We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous.

Not all, but if you have your gay'dar on, you will note a huge number of these men and the sycophants with whom they surround themselves are gay!

She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.

We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true.

How ironic.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: (*In 2016,\u201cgender identity or expression\u201d was added to the Charter;\n**Discrimination based on \u201csexual orientation\u201d has been prohibited since 1977 (Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois); with that change, Qu\u00e9bec became the first jurisdiction in the Americas larger than a city or county to prohibit anti-gay discrimination.) \nThat\u2019s lead Canada (BC + Ont.) to adopt the Civil Marriage Act\u2026\nin 2005 (Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Hillary exemplifies the lack of trust.  She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.  Colleges and public schools have created the robots of liberalism.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: I do like a good tongue twister. But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: my   understanding   is   some transgenders  take  only hormones but don't  remove   the  sexual  organs.   so  he's   a   transgender,  regardless if  he has the  complete   operation.  that's not  my opinion   but  that   of the   transgenders.\nquestion: is tghe   passage   above   toxic?\nAnswer:",

She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.

But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: As I rememba those decades, it wasn't remotely socially acceptable, or even literally safe, to cum out b4 the 1980's, when da scourge of AIDS allowed da beginnings of openness -- starting in da entertainment world and slowly extending to da rest of society EXCEPT those in religious life, where it is still very unwise generally (as evidenced by dis forum whenever dis subject is broached).

Before the 80's, my gay friends lived in silent isolation and desperation, culminating too often in suicide or multiple attempts, and always the objects of hatred, suspicion, discrimination and derision by the \"righteous.\"  Judging by many comments here and recent statements from Trumpland, some still live in those dark days.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

It also shows how completely delusional the hierarchy is, right up to the Pope on matters of homosexuality. Geeze, have you ever been to a gathering of bishops? Not all, but if you have your gay'dar on, you will note a huge number of these men and the sycophants with whom they surround themselves are gay! Now they maybe and are quite likely are chaste, but all the sexual energy is being poured into that gay clerical subculture of power that often finds itself situated in the chancery offices.

She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.  Colleges and public schools have created the robots of liberalism.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: I do like a good tongue twister. But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: The hyperlinked court document in the column addresses that \"sex-change\" information, as provided by Hawaii Free Press; a bit more about the context can be found in the HFP story: http://www.hawaiifreepress.com/ArticlesMain/tabid/56/ID/20112/Kawananakoa-Estate-Sex-Drugs-and-Inequality.aspx, including excerpts and page numbers related to that court document. ...

She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.

It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.

But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: You wrote:\n\n<<The one study, much ballyhooed some years ago that purported to demonstrate a genetic link to homosexuality was proven to be entirely fraudulent.>>\n\nLink?\n\n\"Homoeroticism\" isn't homosexuality.

It also shows how completely delusional the hierarchy is, right up to the Pope on matters of homosexuality. Geeze, have you ever been to a gathering of bishops? Not all, but if you have your gay'dar on, you will note a huge number of these men and the sycophants with whom they surround themselves are gay! Now they maybe and are quite likely are chaste, but all the sexual energy is being poured into that gay clerical subculture of power that often finds itself situated in the chancery offices.

She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.  Colleges and public schools have created the robots of liberalism.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: I do like a good tongue twister. But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Wait, soo today we're lookin back 2000 yrs for context, but when we tlk about homosexuality, we tlk about how da culture has changed and da Church needs to change w/ it?

She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.

We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Wait, so today we're looking back 2000 years for context, but when we talk about homosexuality, we talk about how the culture has changed and the Church needs to change with it?  Thanks.\n\nI've witnessed divorces, indeed, my sister was recently divorced.  They bounced around the idea of staying together, but she decided she just wanted to move on.  A few emails back and forth with a lawyer, and she's out dating living alone, and her adult kids split the holidays between them.  No doubt this bodes well for the marriages of her children.\n\nSo, yes, hoops are important.  And from the couple of annulments that I have also witnessed, the hoops aren't that hard to jump.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.  Colleges and public schools have created the robots of liberalism.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: I do like a good tongue twister. But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Am I mistaken dat \"natural law\" as da basis fa opposing homosexuality, same-sex marriage has become a forgotten term?

A poetic image, a\"complementarity\" of male/female genitalia prevails - and that elevated to doctrine and edict has emerged.  Benedict (16)'ine rhetoric of authoritarian \"ought\" has become the norm. We are seeing a \"last-ditch\" revert to medieval authoritarianism that still fuels the remnants of institutionalism. It, surprisingly still works with some,  helped elect Trump - ugh. That \"some\" coalesces the diminishing cadre of fundamentalist reactionaries, institutional clericalists and fearsome faithful rote fidelists. We should be considerate of the small group of conservatives who see it all as worthwhile; the \"rotists\" who misplace trust in hierarchy. \n\"Natural law\" in a reasonably educated and reason susceptible populace is the bane of the traditionalists and authoritarians.  What \"laws\" emanate from nature are change, variation, chance, a mysterious consistency.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.

Colleges and public schools have created the robots of liberalism.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: I do like a good tongue twister. But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: The Indian Act, largely and historically to the harm of FN people. Should be working to scrap it all, save no agreed alternative yet exists. Very occasionally it may work to the benefit of FN people. But it meets your test.\n\nAny affirmative action measure. Even if it can be justified with reference to policy goals, it also would meet your test.\n\nLooking back, a lot of what we have done is not extend existing rights to new groups so much as expand the list of rights we recognize to exist and/or change the nature of institutions in ways that expand their meaning. That's largely been a good thing, but it's not the same. Just a product of changing mores. The pure romantic/personal/nonreproductive by design idea of marriage to which gay people were admitted is itself a product of late modernity, and would barely have been seen as real marriage even for men and women circa 1945. That conservative 'straights' themselves now largely see it this way is what made this latest change workable.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.

We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Nick, I recall seein something abt Republican legislators tapping outt homosexual luhhh on bathroom stall floors.

I've seen something on Republican legislators lusting after boy interns. This extends to both political parties. The But Clinton won't work. He got a BJ in office and no one died. George Bush lied and hundreds of thousands died. Trump has been proven his political team knew about the Russian hacking and colluded with the Russians to attack his political opponent. He would not have won with out the Russians help and as a result of Russia manipulating the elections, America has lost its military and financial edge over our enemy. Trumps team has committed espionage and should be charged with Treason.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

It also shows how completely delusional the hierarchy is, right up to the Pope on matters of homosexuality. Geeze, have you ever been to a gathering of bishops? Not all, but if you have your gay'dar on, you will note a huge number of these men and the sycophants with whom they surround themselves are gay! Now they maybe and are quite likely are chaste, but all the sexual energy is being poured into that gay clerical subculture of power that often finds itself situated in the chancery offices.

She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.  Colleges and public schools have created the robots of liberalism.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: I do like a good tongue twister. But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Remember D.A.R.E?

A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.

She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.  Colleges and public schools have created the robots of liberalism.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: I do like a good tongue twister. But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: If wat you say is tru, it's pretty lame that da millenials main understanding bout the Catholic church is its teachings on sexuality.

They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: I am just sort of curious, BBurn, but does the press make up Mr. Trump's tweets? How about what he says on TV? Interpretation and speculations of the reasons for his actions are one thing, but his actual words, are those true or \"made up\"? And how about Faux News? Are they the only news outlet whose commentary is unbiased? \n\nBut my real question is what could Trump do or say -- short of giving Ms. Clinton a hug and a kiss, repealing (maybe the wrong word) the right to bear arms, or revealing he was actually gay -- that would lead a Trump supporter to waver in their support?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.  Colleges and public schools have created the robots of liberalism.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: I do like a good tongue twister. But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: You r misrepresenting da Bible.

The letter of the Mosaic Law is not binding on Christians.  Mosaic Law consisted of symbolic, dietary, and moral law.  Symbolic and dietary law were used to foreshadow Christ and prepare a people to spiritually discern clean from unclean, holy from unholy, etc.  The Law was given to prepare Israel and separate them from the nations as God's own people.  In the advent of Christ, symbolic and dietary laws are like GPS - when you arrive at your destination, following the GPS directions is completely useless.  However, God's morality never changed and the moral foundation of the Mosaic Law still applies.  Children should not dishonor their parents yet Christians have no Biblical obligation or even right to stone their children to death.  Bestiality and homosexual practice are still sinful and yet no Christian is obligated to or justified by the Bible to kill homosexual or bestiality practitioners.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

It also shows how completely delusional the hierarchy is, right up to the Pope on matters of homosexuality. Geeze, have you ever been to a gathering of bishops? Not all, but if you have your gay'dar on, you will note a huge number of these men and the sycophants with whom they surround themselves are gay! Now they maybe and are quite likely are chaste, but all the sexual energy is being poured into that gay clerical subculture of power that often finds itself situated in the chancery offices.

She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.  Colleges and public schools have created the robots of liberalism.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: I do like a good tongue twister. But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Well, it's da same and it's not da same, depending on how we look at it.\n\nRavenously consuming fake news, creationsim, da anti-vaxxer movement, da truther movement and, yea, transgenderism alll require rejection of external reality in favor of an internal, preferred reality.

They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Well, it's the same and it's not the same, depending on how we look at it.\n\nRavenously consuming fake news, creationsim, the anti-vaxxer movement, the truther movement and, yes, transgenderism all require rejection of external reality in favor of an internal, preferred reality.  In this, they are the same.  \n\nAs St. Thomas Aquinas  demonstrates, \"[T]ruth is defined by the conformity of intellect and thing; and hence to know this conformity is to know truth. \u2026. When [the intellect] judges that a thing corresponds to the form which it apprehends about that thing, then first it knows and expresses truth.\"\n\nTransgenderism is different because, unlike these other embracing of falsehood (except perhaps creationism), it touches what is essentially, substantially human.  Because it is substantial, it underlies human nature and, in the case of transgenderism, undermines human dignity.  In this, transgenderism is even more damaging to the entire notion of truth than the other falsehoods at play.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true.

Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.  Colleges and public schools have created the robots of liberalism.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: I do like a good tongue twister. But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: I was with  you for your first three developments.  However, I can't support you on ##4 and 5.  \"My preference, however, would be the dissolution of the \"clerical state\" and it not again seen as ontologically superior or differentiated from the People of God. (In other words, we don't need magic or magicians to welcome the Eucharistic Presence.) 5) Rethinking & updating ALL of theology for the 22nd century, INCLUDING WOMEN, and build Jesus' Kingdom with love, not fear.\"  The Sacrament of Orders commissions a specific  ministry: priesthood.  I agree that women and homosexuals should not be discriminated against on this issue or any other.  Regarding #5, it is of the essence of theology that it develop.  As a process, theology is constantly  examining the evolving faith of the community and looking for consensus ways to affirm it for the Church.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

It also shows how completely delusional the hierarchy is, right up to the Pope on matters of homosexuality. Geeze, have you ever been to a gathering of bishops? Not all, but if you have your gay'dar on, you will note a huge number of these men and the sycophants with whom they surround themselves are gay! Now they maybe and are quite likely are chaste, but all the sexual energy is being poured into that gay clerical subculture of power that often finds itself situated in the chancery offices. How ironic.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: (*In 2016,\u201cgender identity or expression\u201d was added to the Charter;\n**Discrimination based on \u201csexual orientation\u201d has been prohibited since 1977 (Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois); with that change, Qu\u00e9bec became the first jurisdiction in the Americas larger than a city or county to prohibit anti-gay discrimination.) \nThat\u2019s lead Canada (BC + Ont.) to adopt the Civil Marriage Act\u2026\nin 2005 (Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Hillary exemplifies the lack of trust.  She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.  Colleges and public schools have created the robots of liberalism.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: I do like a good tongue twister. But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: yours   is  a   terribly  misguided, narrow,   and  intolerant   wiew.   what   we've here is   a   baker  who  wishes  to   put  his   christian belief into  action.   you want  to discriminate against   him  because  of  it. you aren\u2019t  against discrimination...   you're  against specific  forms  of   discrimination.   \ni abhor   racial   discrimination.  and   i  don\u2019t believe  that   gays  should be   mistreated.  redefining   marriage  to  accommodate   sinful lifestyles   hasn\u2019t been  an anti-discrimination   accomplishment, it  has   merely   been   the   redefining  of an  historical   institution   to  accomate a paticular group   who don\u2019t  like  hearing their lifestyle   is sinful.   re-ordering   society in  such a manner   and  expecting  everyone   to  bow   down   in   acquiescence   is  discriminory.  for you   it\u2019s   \u201cno   dogs  or   christians.\u201d\nquestion: is   the  passage above  toxic?\nAnswer:",

It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.

A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.

It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.

It also shows how completely delusional the hierarchy is, right up to the Pope on matters of homosexuality. Geeze, have you ever been to a gathering of bishops? Not all, but if you have your gay'dar on, you will note a huge number of these men and the sycophants with whom they surround themselves are gay! Now they maybe and are quite likely are chaste, but all the sexual energy is being poured into that gay clerical subculture of power that often finds itself situated in the chancery offices.

She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.  Colleges and public schools have created the robots of liberalism.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: I do like a good tongue twister. But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Kevin tells us his core values r \"women\u2019s rights, minority rights, LGBTQ rights, access to quality education, reproductive health and choice and da environmental protection.\"  And he urges those among us who share his core values to \"take our country bacc.\"\n\nBut dere are quite a lot of us Islanders whose core values r jobs, economic growth, and a strong defense.

And in the November election, we did \"take our country back.\"\n\nKevin says he won't comprise on his core values: \u201cThese are issues where it\u2019s black or white; you\u2019re with me, or you\u2019re wrong.\u201d\n\nThat isn't leadership.  That's arrogance.\n\nKevin, the elections are over.  At least for a while, let's all try to rise above petty politics and find ways to work together.

She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.

Please don\u2019t try comparing apples with oranges.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: What a disappointment! It also shows how completely delusional the hierarchy is, right up to the Pope on matters of homosexuality. Geeze, have you ever been to a gathering of bishops? Not all, but if you have your gay'dar on, you will note a huge number of these men and the sycophants with whom they surround themselves are gay! Now they maybe and are quite likely are chaste, but all the sexual energy is being poured into that gay clerical subculture of power that often finds itself situated in the chancery offices. How ironic.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: (*In 2016,\u201cgender identity or expression\u201d was added to the Charter;\n**Discrimination based on \u201csexual orientation\u201d has been prohibited since 1977 (Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois); with that change, Qu\u00e9bec became the first jurisdiction in the Americas larger than a city or county to prohibit anti-gay discrimination.) \nThat\u2019s lead Canada (BC + Ont.) to adopt the Civil Marriage Act\u2026\nin 2005 (Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Hillary exemplifies the lack of trust.  She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.  Colleges and public schools have created the robots of liberalism.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: I do like a good tongue twister. But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: While agree whole heartedly witt Outsider's perspective I would add da following. \n\n[1].

The whole issue of abortion would have been and would certainly be better handled on a State by State bases by the voters of each State. \n\n[2]. The SCOTUS was never intended to act as an activist court in any matter of the law their existence is to interpret law not write new laws.  Roe vs. Wade, homosexual marriage are such examples.\n\n[3]. Abortion should not be funded by federal or State tax dollars with only three exceptions rape, incest, and the medical verification of the potential loss of the mothers life. \n\n[4]. I believe one would be hard pressed to find many individuals who hold firmly to a 100% pro-life stance. While I personally do not support abortion i.e., a form of terminal birth-control on demand, I do support abortion in cases of rape, incest and a medical verification of the potential loss of the mothers life.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

Please don\u2019t try comparing apples with oranges.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: What a disappointment! It also shows how completely delusional the hierarchy is, right up to the Pope on matters of homosexuality. Geeze, have you ever been to a gathering of bishops? Not all, but if you have your gay'dar on, you will note a huge number of these men and the sycophants with whom they surround themselves are gay! Now they maybe and are quite likely are chaste, but all the sexual energy is being poured into that gay clerical subculture of power that often finds itself situated in the chancery offices. How ironic.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: (*In 2016,\u201cgender identity or expression\u201d was added to the Charter;\n**Discrimination based on \u201csexual orientation\u201d has been prohibited since 1977 (Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois); with that change, Qu\u00e9bec became the first jurisdiction in the Americas larger than a city or county to prohibit anti-gay discrimination.) \nThat\u2019s lead Canada (BC + Ont.) to adopt the Civil Marriage Act\u2026\nin 2005 (Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Hillary exemplifies the lack of trust.  She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.  Colleges and public schools have created the robots of liberalism.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: I do like a good tongue twister. But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: A previous bishop in San Diego did da same thing--denied a funeral to a gay man.

She is the most corrupt individual to ever run for president.  Why in the world the middle or lower class would vote for her is beyond my understanding.  A rigged election is not conspiracy it is fact.  Hillarys buddy soros has election machines in 17 states.  He is a known globalist who is salivating at the opportunity to watch America fall and be absorbed into a new world order.  Its not conspiracy at all.  It is common knowledge that Hillary and Soros have the same sick goal for America.  They want to level the playing field world wide and pride themselves in being the orchestrator of that.  Only problem is they need to rob America of its wealth to make that happen.  Trump would stand in the way of their goal.  Liberals are willing to run off a cliff with Hillary and Soros strictly because of Hillarys stance on abortion, gay rights, etc.  That is the trap they have set.

But the rest of your comment, to me, can be easily judged by a simple test. A child can't give consent to sex because they are young enough to be manipulated. We make this act illegal to prevent a child being taken advantage of. \n\nIf a person's brain is wired like the opposite gender and they want to act on that and they are old enough to consent to their own actions, is there a problem? I don't think it should be an issue just because of slippery slope sliding. \n\nThe problem is if, as you say, everyone else has to go along with it despite believing it is sinful or weird or dangerous. People that think having a transgender person in a bathroom is dangerous probably thinks transgendered are perverts and likely to attack a child. This is demonstrably not true. They may be uncomfortable because of \"the different\" and I have some sympathy for that... humans need time.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: A previous bishop in San Diego did the same thing--denied a funeral to a gay man. Although eventually the Bishop rescinded the rejection, the family went to the Episcopalians for a funeral.   Of course San Diego was at the time the home of now-Abp Cordileone, that fierce opponent of equal marriage. That wasn't the only one, either.   Little wonder that so many Catholics started worshiping with the Episcopalians, given the viciously anti-gay rhetoric from the Diocese at that time.\n\n  Nowadays, San Diego Catholics have Bp Robert McElroy, who is much more interested in building bridges than walls.  Still, I suspect much damage was done, particularly amongst the young.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

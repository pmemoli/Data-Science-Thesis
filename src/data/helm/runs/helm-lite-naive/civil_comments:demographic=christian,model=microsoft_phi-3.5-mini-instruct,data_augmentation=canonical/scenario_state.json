Christ prayed that they may become one. Certain good things did emerge from the reformation (because God draws good from evil) like the counter reformation, but the fracture of Christ's flock in the west cannot be celebrated. Unlike some, I don't think Luther was an evil man by any means. I view him as a tragic figure. If he had not left the Church he could have been the next Saint Francis of Assisi; a great former who \"rebuilt\" the church through his witness and holy example. There would be Saint Luther churches all over and western Christianity would be united. In my view, it is a tragedy history did not go this way.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

One doesn\u2019t have to fight one\u2019s way into the space at Jesus\u2019 feet.

This is true no matter which  of our member's has erred and sinned in supporting the attack against human dignity - even if that person is the Pope.  This is why it is so important that our faith upholds primacy of conscience. \n\nAs for the million years nonsense.  God rules this church and demands those who have been oppressed believe, pray and stand up  for justice and then he delivers it to them.  Faith conquers any person's stubbornness.  So it is quite right to continue to demand of the hierarchy, till their ears fall off, \"We demand women be ordained priests today!\" and demand this everyday - until they are ordained.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?"

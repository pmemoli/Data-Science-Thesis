Trump's juvenile name-calling and attempting to drag Mrs. Cruz over the hot coals to get at her husband is disgusting.  So what if Mrs. Cruz sought mental health counseling.  It's too bad Trump hasn't gotten a clue that he needs psycho therapy, but there's no cure for a narcissist.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: I'll say this:  He's prison-ready!\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Yes! But just to very clear, you would write a message that reads like a petition advocating 1500 characters, and you end by inviting readers to click the \"like\" star as their way of supporting your proposal. You might even add, that CC would then have a complete list of the names on those \"signing\" the petition, although we only see the latest crop. \n\nAnd, you COULD also created a continuation \"reply to self\" inviting those who disagree, who want the 1000 character limit to be retained, to click that message's \"like\" star.\n\nAnd, to get maximum exposure, you might try and be one of the first on a story with this petition-comment. \n----------------\nAnd to follow your change of topic, I want to reply obliquely. In my town, there is an important Jesuit retreat centre, catering to an international crowd. Rather remarkably, among lay folk in town, there appears to be a much greater local interest in Ignatian prayer in Protestants congregations than Catholics parishes, even a Jesuit parish.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

Just like every other religion there are various groups within it - and in many, dreadlocks ARE essential.\nBut that is beside the point, the concourt has already found that non-essential observances are ALSO protected - specifically in the case of school rules. In that case about a Hindu girl who wanted to wear the large earings. The school argued that previous nose-stud case doesn't apply since the earings are optional throughout the religion. The court found that observing an optional aspect of a religion is an even MORE devotional act exactly because the religion does NOT mandate it absolute -and is thus even MORE protected.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

The risk ratio is close to the value one, so there is no difference in disease risk between the two groups.\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about iodine is correct, as of 2020?\n\nA. 50% of adults consume iodine at levels below the RNI\nB. Dairy products are a poor source of iodine\nC. The iodine content of organic milk is generally lower that the level in non-organic milk\nD. UK dietary reference values recommend an increase in iodine intake in pregnancy\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion: What is the first-line drug for patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity, as of 2020?\n\nA. Acarbose\nB. Metformin\nC. Sulphonylureas\nD. Insulin\nAnswer: B\n\nQuestion: which statment   about  protein digestion  and absorption is  most  correct?\n\nA. The products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides\nB. Gastric digestion of all proteins is equally efficient because of the grinding action of the antrum\nC. Gastric zymogenic (chief) cells produce and secrete chymotrypsin, elastase and carboxypeptidase A and this initiates the process of protein digestion\nD. The products of digestion of dietary protein by luminal and brush-border enzymes are only absorbed by one of the 14 different amino acid transporters\nAnswer:",

The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging (box, user's guide, bubble wrap, etc.) has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams. Together, the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation:\nA. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 7.0 grams\nB. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 3.5 grams\nC. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nD. Mean 394 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion: Which of the following sets has the smallest standard deviation? Which has the largest?\nI: {1,2,3}\nII: {-10,10}\nIII: {100}\n\nA. I, II\nB. II, III\nC. III, I\nD. III, II\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: After a frost warning was issued, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water. The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12. What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?\nA. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 8.5\nB. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 13\nC. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 17\nD. There is insufficient information to answer this question.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is a correct statement about correlation?\nA. If the slope of the regression line is exactly 1, then the correlation is exactly 1.\nB. If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the regression line is undefined.\nC. Switching which variable is called x and which is called y changes the sign of the correlation.\nD. The correlation r is equal to the slope of the regression line when z-scores for the y-variable are plotted against z-scores for the x-variable.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: The midterm scores for a statistics course were approximately normally distributed with a mean of 52 points and a standard deviation of 4 points. The final exam scores were approximately normally distributed with a mean of 112 points and a standard deviation of 10 points. One student had a score of 58 points on the midterm.

The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12.

The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12.

The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging (box, user's guide, bubble wrap, etc.) has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams. Together, the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation:\nA. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 7.0 grams\nB. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 3.5 grams\nC. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nD. Mean 394 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion: Which of the following sets has the smallest standard deviation?

III, II\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: After a frost warning was issued, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water. The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12. What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?\nA. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 8.5\nB. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 13\nC. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 17\nD. There is insufficient information to answer this question.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is a correct statement about correlation?\nA. If the slope of the regression line is exactly 1, then the correlation is exactly 1.\nB. If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the regression line is undefined.\nC. Switching which variable is called x and which is called y changes the sign of the correlation.\nD. The correlation r is equal to the slope of the regression line when z-scores for the y-variable are plotted against z-scores for the x-variable.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Two variables, xand y, seem to be exponentially related. The natural logarithm of each yvalue is taken and the least-squares regression line of ln(y) on xis determined to be ln(y) = 3.2 + 0.42x.

The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging (box, user's guide, bubble wrap, etc.) has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams. Together, the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation:\nA. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 7.0 grams\nB. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 3.5 grams\nC. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nD. Mean 394 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion: Which of the following sets has the smallest standard deviation?

III, II\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: After a frost warning was issued, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water. The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12. What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?\nA. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 8.5\nB. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 13\nC. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 17\nD. There is insufficient information to answer this question.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is a correct statement about correlation?\nA. If the slope of the regression line is exactly 1, then the correlation is exactly 1.\nB. If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the regression line is undefined.\nC. Switching which variable is called x and which is called y changes the sign of the correlation.\nD. The correlation r is equal to the slope of the regression line when z-scores for the y-variable are plotted against z-scores for the x-variable.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is a binomial random variable?\nA. The number of tosses before a \"5\" appears when tossing a fair die.\nB. The number of points a hockey team receives in 10 games, where two points are awarded for wins, one point for ties, and no points for losses.\nC. The number of hearts out of five cards randomly drawn from a deck of 52 cards, without replacement.\nD. The number of motorists not wearing seat belts in a random sample of five drivers.\nAnswer:",

        "prompt": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school statistics.\n\nQuestion: A new smartwatch is manufactured in one part of a factory, then secured for shipping in another, independent part of the factory. The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging (box, user's guide, bubble wrap, etc.) has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams. Together, the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation:\nA. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 7.0 grams\nB. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 3.5 grams\nC. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nD. Mean 394 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion: Which of the following sets has the smallest standard deviation? Which has the largest?\nI: {1,2,3}\nII: {-10,10}\nIII: {100}\n\nA. I, II\nB. II, III\nC. III, I\nD. III, II\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: After a frost warning was issued, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water. The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12. What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?\nA. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 8.5\nB. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 13\nC. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 17\nD. There is insufficient information to answer this question.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is a correct statement about correlation?\nA. If the slope of the regression line is exactly 1, then the correlation is exactly 1.\nB. If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the regression line is undefined.\nC. Switching which variable is called x and which is called y changes the sign of the correlation.\nD. The correlation r is equal to the slope of the regression line when z-scores for the y-variable are plotted against z-scores for the x-variable.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT true of the \u03c72 probability distribution function?\nA. The area under the \u03c72 curve is 1.\nB. \u03c72 is defined only for nonnegative values of the variable.\nC. For small degrees of freedom, the curve displays strong right-skewness.\nD.

The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging (box, user's guide, bubble wrap, etc.) has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams. Together, the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation:\nA. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 7.0 grams\nB. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 3.5 grams\nC. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nD. Mean 394 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion: Which of the following sets has the smallest standard deviation? Which has the largest?\nI: {1,2,3}\nII: {-10,10}\nIII: {100}\n\nA. I, II\nB. II, III\nC. III, I\nD. III, II\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: After a frost warning was issued, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water. The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12. What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?\nA. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 8.5\nB. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 13\nC. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 17\nD. There is insufficient information to answer this question.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is a correct statement about correlation?\nA. If the slope of the regression line is exactly 1, then the correlation is exactly 1.\nB. If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the regression line is undefined.\nC. Switching which variable is called x and which is called y changes the sign of the correlation.\nD. The correlation r is equal to the slope of the regression line when z-scores for the y-variable are plotted against z-scores for the x-variable.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Which of these explains why t should be used instead of z for inference procedures for means.\nA. The Central Limit Theorem applies to proportions but not means.\nB. We use z for proportions because proportions are approximately normal. Means are not.\nC. We use z for proportions because the sampling distribution of sample proportions is approximately normal, but that is not the case for the sampling distribution of sample means.\nD. When using the sample standard deviation to estimate the population standard deviation, more variability is introduced into the sampling distribution of the statistic.\nAnswer:",

The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging (box, user's guide, bubble wrap, etc.) has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams. Together, the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation:\nA. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 7.0 grams\nB. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 3.5 grams\nC. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nD.

III, II\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: After a frost warning was issued, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water. The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12. What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?\nA. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 8.5\nB. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 13\nC. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 17\nD. There is insufficient information to answer this question.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is a correct statement about correlation?\nA. If the slope of the regression line is exactly 1, then the correlation is exactly 1.\nB. If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the regression line is undefined.\nC. Switching which variable is called x and which is called y changes the sign of the correlation.\nD. The correlation r is equal to the slope of the regression line when z-scores for the y-variable are plotted against z-scores for the x-variable.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: A hypothesis test is set up so that P(rejecting H0 when H0 is true) = 0.05 and P(failing to reject H0 when H0 is false) = 0.26.

The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12.

To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12. What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?\nA. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 8.5\nB. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 13\nC. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 17\nD. There is insufficient information to answer this question.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is a correct statement about correlation?\nA. If the slope of the regression line is exactly 1, then the correlation is exactly 1.\nB. If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the regression line is undefined.\nC. Switching which variable is called x and which is called y changes the sign of the correlation.\nD. The correlation r is equal to the slope of the regression line when z-scores for the y-variable are plotted against z-scores for the x-variable.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: which  of  the   following is a true   statement?\nA. While observational studies gather information on an already existing condition, they still often involve intentionally forcing some treatment to note the response.\nB. In an experiment, researchers decide on the treatment but typically allow the subjects to self-select into the control group.\nC. If properly designed, either observational studies or controlled experiments can easily be used to establish cause and effect.\nD. Stratifying in sampling is the same idea as blocking for experiments.\nAnswer:",

The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12.

The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12.

He is considering the purchase of a different type of hen, so he took a random sample of 18 eggs laid by this type of hen. The distribution of the masses is symmetric and mound-shaped with a mean of 54.1 grams and no outliers. The farmer conducted a t-test to see if there is evidence that the eggs from these hens have a mean mass that is different from 56 g and got a test statistic of t= -1.973. If he uses a 5% significance level, which is the correct conclusion and reason?\nA. Because tis more extreme than \u00b11.96, he should reject the null hypothesis. He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\nB. Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 17 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\nC.

The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12. What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?\nA. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 8.5\nB. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 13\nC. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 17\nD. There is insufficient information to answer this question.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is a correct statement about correlation?\nA. If the slope of the regression line is exactly 1, then the correlation is exactly 1.\nB. If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the regression line is undefined.\nC. Switching which variable is called x and which is called y changes the sign of the correlation.\nD. The correlation r is equal to the slope of the regression line when z-scores for the y-variable are plotted against z-scores for the x-variable.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: A farmer who raises hens fa egg production wants his eggs to have a mean mass of 56 grams. He is considering da purchase of a diff type of hen, soo he took a random sample of 18 eggs laid by dis type of hen. Da distribution of da masses is symmetric and mound-shaped witt a mean of 54.1 grams and no outliers. Da farmer conducted a t-test to see if dere is evidence dat the eggs from dese hens have a mean mass dat is diff from 56 g and got a test statistic of t= -1.973. If he uses a 5% significance level, which is da correct conclusion and reason?\nA. Because tis more extreme den \u00b11.96, he should reject da null hypothesis. He has convincing evidence at da 5% significance level dat the mean mass of eggs from dese hens is diff from 56 grams.\nB. Because tis less extreme den the critical value of t fa 17 degrees of freedom, he should not reject da null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at da 5% significance level dat the mean mass of eggs from dese hens is diff from 56 grams.\nC. Because tis less extreme den the critical value of t fir 18 degrees of freedom, he should not reject da null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at da 5% significance level dat the mean mass of eggs from dese hens is diffrent from 56 grams.\nD.

III, II\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: After a frost warning was issued, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water. The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12.

III, II\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: After a frost warning was issued, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water. The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12.

III, II\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: After a frost warning was issued, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water. The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12.

The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging (box, user's guide, bubble wrap, etc.) has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams. Together, the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation:\nA. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 7.0 grams\nB. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 3.5 grams\nC. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nD.

III, II\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: After a frost warning was issued, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water. The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12. What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?\nA. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 8.5\nB. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 13\nC. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 17\nD. There is insufficient information to answer this question.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is a correct statement about correlation?\nA. If the slope of the regression line is exactly 1, then the correlation is exactly 1.\nB. If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the regression line is undefined.\nC. Switching which variable is called x and which is called y changes the sign of the correlation.\nD. The correlation r is equal to the slope of the regression line when z-scores for the y-variable are plotted against z-scores for the x-variable.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: A talk show host recently reported that in response to his on-air question, 82% of the more than 2500 e-mail messages received through his publicized address supported the death penalty for anyone convicted of selling drugs to children. What does this show?\nA. The survey is meaningless because of voluntary response bias.\nB.

III, II\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: After a frost warning was issued, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water. The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12.

III, II\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: After a frost warning was issued, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water. The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12.

There is insufficient information to answer this question.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is a correct statement about correlation?\nA. If the slope of the regression line is exactly 1, then the correlation is exactly 1.\nB. If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the regression line is undefined.\nC. Switching which variable is called x and which is called y changes the sign of the correlation.\nD. The correlation r is equal to the slope of the regression line when z-scores for the y-variable are plotted against z-scores for the x-variable.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: After receiving several complaints from his customers about the store being closed on Sundays, a storekeeper decided to conduct a survey. He randomly selected 100 female customers and 120 male customers, and asked them, \"Are you interested in shopping at this store on Sundays?\" He counted the number of customers answering \"yes\" and constructed a 95 percent confidence interval for the difference by subtracting the proportions of female from the proportion of male customers in favor of shopping on Sundays. The resulting interval was (\u20130.23, \u20130.18). Which of the following is a correct interpretation of the interval?\nA. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays.\nB. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays.\nC. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays is equal to the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays.\nD.

The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12.

The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12.

The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12. What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?\nA. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 8.5\nB. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 13\nC. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 17\nD. There is insufficient information to answer this question.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is a correct statement about correlation?\nA. If the slope of the regression line is exactly 1, then the correlation is exactly 1.\nB. If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the regression line is undefined.\nC.

The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12. What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?\nA. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 8.5\nB. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 13\nC. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 17\nD.

        "prompt": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school statistics.\n\nQuestion: A new smartwatch is manufactured in one part of a factory, then secured for shipping in another, independent part of the factory. The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging (box, user's guide, bubble wrap, etc.) has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams. Together, the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation:\nA. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 7.0 grams\nB. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 3.5 grams\nC. Mean 518 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nD. Mean 394 grams; standard deviation 6.1 grams\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion: Which of the following sets has the smallest standard deviation? Which has the largest?\nI: {1,2,3}\nII: {-10,10}\nIII: {100}\n\nA. I, II\nB. II, III\nC. III, I\nD. III, II\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: After a frost warning was issued, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water. The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?\nA. The proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to frost.\nB. The number of trees affected by the frost.\nC. The number of trees sampled from the grove.\nD. For each sampled tree, whether it suffered more than 50 percent damage or at most 50 percent damage.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12. What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?\nA. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 8.5\nB. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 13\nC. E(X + Y) = 99, var(X + Y) = 17\nD. There is insufficient information to answer this question.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is a correct statement about correlation?\nA. If the slope of the regression line is exactly 1, then the correlation is exactly 1.\nB. If the correlation is 0, then the slope of the regression line is undefined.\nC. Switching which variable is called x and which is called y changes the sign of the correlation.\nD. The correlation r is equal to the slope of the regression line when z-scores for the y-variable are plotted against z-scores for the x-variable.\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: During da years 1886 thru 2000 dere were an average of 8.7 tropical cyclones per year, of which an average of 5.1 became hurricanes.

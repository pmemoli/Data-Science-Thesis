Cyclins\nB. Protein kinases\nC. Checkpoints\nD. Fibroblast cells\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: A mutation in a bacterial enzyme changed a previously polar amino acid into a nonpolar amino acid. This amino acid was located at a site distant from the enzyme\u2019s active site. How might this mutation alter the enzyme\u2019s substrate specificity?\nA.

Which of da following statement best explains how da resistant mosquitoes arose?\nA. Some mosquitoes experienced a mutation after bein exposed to DDT dat made em resistant to da insecticide. Then their population expanded bc these moquitoes had no competition.\nB. Some mosquitoes were already resistant to DDT when DDT was first sprayed. Then their population expanded cuz all da susceptible mosquitoes had been exterminated.\nC. DDT is generally a very effective insecticide. One can only conclude dat it was manufactured improperly.\nD. Although DDT is effective against a wide range of roaches, it is not effective against mosquitoes.\nAnswer:",

A yeast cell dat is fed on glucose is moved from an aerobic to an anaerobic environment. Which of da following statements is correct and gives da correct reason fir it?\nA. The cell dies cause it cannot make ATP.\nB. The cell would need to consume glucose at a much greater rate b/c aerobic respiration is much more efficient as compared wit anaerobic respiration.\nC. The cell would need to consume anotha food source other den glucose b/c it gon not b able to make adequate ATP wid only glucose.\nD. The cell gon begin to divide rapidly b/c larger cells require more oxygen and glucose den smaller ones.\nAnswer:",

By changing the enzyme\u2019s pH optimum\nB. By changing the enzyme\u2019s location in the cell\nC. By changing the shape of the protein\nD. An amino acid change away from the active site cannot alter the enzyme\u2019s substrate specificity.\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion: Homologous structures are often cited as evidence for the process of natural selection. All of the following are examples of homologous structures EXCEPT\nA. the wings of a bird and the wings of a bat\nB. the flippers of a whale and the arms of a man\nC. the pectoral fins of a porpoise and the flippers of a seal\nD. the forelegs of an insect and the forelimbs of a dog\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is not a way to form recombinant DNA?\nA. Translation\nB. Conjugation\nC. Specialized transduction\nD. Transformation\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: Many diff fermentation pathways occur in diffrent organisms in nature. Fa example, skeletal muscle cells convert pyruvate into lactic acid when no oxygen is present. Yeast cells can produce alcohol and carbon dioxide under da same circumstances. However, regardless of da specific reactions, da purpose of glycolysis is an important one. Which statement best describes da importance of glycolysis?\nA. It produces bigass amounts of ATP by substrate level phosphorylation.\nB. It reoxidizes NADH soo that glycolysis can continue.\nC. It produces pyruvate, which is da raw material fir oxidative phosphorylation.\nD. It occurs in da cytoplasm.\nAnswer:",

Plasma membrane\u2013Golgi apparatus\u2013ribosome\u2013secretory vesicle\u2013rough ER\nB. Ribosome\u2013Golgi apparatus\u2013rough ER\u2013secretory vesicle\u2013plasma membrane\nC. Plasma membrane\u2013Golgi apparatus\u2013ribosome\u2013secretory vesicle\u2013rough ER\nD. Ribosome\u2013rough ER\u2013Golgi apparatus\u2013secretory vesicle\u2013plasma membrane\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is not known to be involved in the control of cell division?\nA. Cyclins\nB. Protein kinases\nC. Checkpoints\nD. Fibroblast cells\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: A mutation in a bacterial enzyme changed a previously polar amino acid into a nonpolar amino acid. This amino acid was located at a site distant from the enzyme\u2019s active site. How might this mutation alter the enzyme\u2019s substrate specificity?\nA. By changing the enzyme\u2019s pH optimum\nB. By changing the enzyme\u2019s location in the cell\nC. By changing the shape of the protein\nD. An amino acid change away from the active site cannot alter the enzyme\u2019s substrate specificity.\nAnswer: C\n\nQuestion: Homologous structures are often cited as evidence for the process of natural selection. All of the following are examples of homologous structures EXCEPT\nA. the wings of a bird and the wings of a bat\nB. the flippers of a whale and the arms of a man\nC. the pectoral fins of a porpoise and the flippers of a seal\nD. the forelegs of an insect and the forelimbs of a dog\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is not a way to form recombinant DNA?\nA. Translation\nB. Conjugation\nC. Specialized transduction\nD. Transformation\nAnswer: A\n\nQuestion: During a study session bout evolution, one of yo fellow students remarks, \"Da giraffe stretched its neck while reachin for higher leaves; its offspring inherited longer necks as a result.\" Which statement is most likely to b helpful in correcting dis student's misconception?\nA. Characteristics acquired durin an organism's life r generally not passed on thru genes.\nB. Spontaneous mutations can result in da appearance of new traits.\nC. Only favorable adaptations have survival value.\nD. Disuse of an organ may lead to its eventual disappearance.\nAnswer:",

Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps.

What's worse than \"playing the victim\" is being jealous of those who've actually been victims.  That's pretty much all your complaints amount to.  Shall I get out my harmonica and play you some \"white man's blues\"?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: For a developmental QB, the broken wrist isn't much, but I stand by the fact that his off field issues pushed him to be a 7th rounder more than his injuries.  No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: for  too  many  years the media  has been biased  and downright  hateful  to  republicans ,   conservatives  and   libertarians.   they've   lied abbout vietnam  , were  totally   aganist nixon even when he did some pretty  fine   things ,  helped  stop bush 41   and hated  bush 43. \nthey'd not say anything   about   obama that  wasn't  praising him even   though   in 8   years he did littel that   was  good   and  in   reality   caused   more   racism   and   bigotry  besides   raising  the level   of   hatred in  america  while acting in   a total un   bi-partisan  fashion  to   pass   his  so  called  agenda.\npelosi ,  reid   and   now   schumer   and  the  insane  maxine   waters  are pouring  gasoline   on  hten flames and   onyl   making   it   worse.   and   the media   is   backing  them   up   ,   refusing   to   take   them  to task for   their   rotten behavior because   the  media   agrees   with  them. \nthey   call  white  republicans  supremacists   hwile  forgetting it   was  white  republicans who got   lbj's  civil  rights bill   passed  while   dems  were siccing  dogs   on little   girls.  abc   , cbs, nbc,   cnn   , msnbc  \nstink.\nquestion: is the passage   above  toxic?\nAnswer:",

Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps.

Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: 76% white.

No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: \"at the hands of the hating white men\" \"Hellen Zille...retains the levers of power that reinforces coloniality in the Cape\"\n\nSteve Biko might have been a just man, fighting for a just cause, but clearly those singing his praise today are just using it as an excuse to blatantly express their racism and anti-democratic tendencies.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: There's no socialist equivalent for the Democrats to the white nationalists who are part and parcel of the GOP. \n\nBro' with all due respect, you probably wouldn't know a socialist if he/she sat on your lap and called you papa.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps.

Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps.

In large urban areas the police response is more aggressive in some cases, dealing with gangs, but not shootings. Overall, the number of citizens shot/killed by police shows no disparity or a racial bias. Hence, the number of whites, blacks, Hispanics ... is evenly matched and not by percentage per capita. So the conclusion, all of us, that is all of us, have the same chance given approach and response of taking rounds from police. Anchorage this week is an example. The last American-African I recall being shot and killed was a guy named \"Smitty\" by a trooper on Tudor Road behind that cowboy bar that's gone, over 35 years ago. Most shot and killed in Alaska are white, then natives.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?"

No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: I know why Trudeau kept none of his election promises re: aboriginals. He made the promises to out-NDP the NDP and get votes from gullible virtue-signalling university \"educated\" leftist WHITE people and never intended to keep them in the first place. That's why. And it worked.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Please no need for a personal attack, I have done nothing to disparage you, while I do not condone the method of mining allowed and legal in Canada, it certainly is better than using the cyanide leaching process or the use of mercury for separation of gold, methods allowed in most of the gold producing countries, by the way I was born here in Alaska along with the generations of my forbears, white person!\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps.

What's worse than \"playing the victim\" is being jealous of those who've actually been victims.  That's pretty much all your complaints amount to.  Shall I get out my harmonica and play you some \"white man's blues\"?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: For a developmental QB, the broken wrist isn't much, but I stand by the fact that his off field issues pushed him to be a 7th rounder more than his injuries.  No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: \"Just because the activity is not immediately perceptible, however, does not mean that the need for action is any less dire.\"\n\nThis quote sums up the paranoid mentality behind this sorry piece of sloppy journalism.

You can't be serious that ESPN did the right thing by moving Robert Lee to another game and you can't really believe he supported the move except for no other reason as his bosses thought he should support it and as a good employee he did what his bosses asked since it wasn't a crime or immoral.  I don't know about you but I totally believe I know what is racist and what isn't and I also understand not just whites can be racist.  This is just PC gone nuts and why I don't live by the PC rules.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: I am not clear where this persecution complex comes from. Even today, 85 percent of CEOs and 100 percent of Prime Ministers are white males. Let's go one step further. In a  technology company in the US (a friend pointed this out to me), the engineers are largely Asian. As you go up the organizational chart, it gets whiter. Unless the company is founded by an Asian. \n\nUnfortunately, the percentage of CEOs and VPs and Prime Minsters is going to see less white males in the future (its impossible to increase the percentage of white males who will be PMs, for example). This cannot be considered generosity or a sacrifice. It is just laws of statistics playing out.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

What's worse than \"playing the victim\" is being jealous of those who've actually been victims.  That's pretty much all your complaints amount to.  Shall I get out my harmonica and play you some \"white man's blues\"?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: For a developmental QB, the broken wrist isn't much, but I stand by the fact that his off field issues pushed him to be a 7th rounder more than his injuries.  No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: it   ain't   gonna  happen  bill.   9/11 never   threatened   our   national  integrity,  if  anything   it  strengthened our   national commitment.  hand  guns   weren't worth a   damn  in   stopping   thge   9/11   terrorist,  or  the   ok city bomber.(the white guy who  did  think  he  could  start  a  war) \n\nmexico  is   a   bit   special. repblicans, through   reagan  had open   arms  for  immigrant   labor, it's a  well  know   fact   that  california  agriculture weas   a  big   influence  on rr  and   for good  reason -   it   benefitted   the   nation\n\nmy wife   was  raised   in  santa clara. they   had   mexican  families in that area   long before   it was a  us state. not sure how   they'd   be   considered   an  'invasion'.   \n\nliek you,  i'm serious   worried  about   violent   latin american  gangs that have   overrun  some of their own weak local  governments,  even  corrupted  those nations   politics.  we're   totally united in condemning/convicting/punishing  those  gangs.\nquestion:  is  thge   passage   above  toxic?\nAnswer:",

What's worse than \"playing the victim\" is being jealous of those who've actually been victims.  That's pretty much all your complaints amount to.  Shall I get out my harmonica and play you some \"white man's blues\"?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: For a developmental QB, the broken wrist isn't much, but I stand by the fact that his off field issues pushed him to be a 7th rounder more than his injuries.  No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: \"When his supporters start to b disillusioned, Rodrik fears Trump may react to any criticism by intensifying his identity politics. \"\n\nOf course he gon.

Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south.

That's what fascist leaders always do when things go awry - scapegoat some unpopular group: Muslims, Mexicans, gays, you name it - whatever works. That way the (white) rubes who foolishly believed that Trump would save them from the \"evils\" that a Hillary Clinton presidency would bring won't have to look in the mirror and blame themselves when blaming an unpopular group is so much easier. Hitler had the Jews, Trump will have, well, we'll just have to wait and see. But mark my word, there will be scapegoats one way or another. Anything to avoid confronting the real truth: that the GOP is all about propping up the 1% at everyone else's expense and Trump is all about lining his own pockets with as much gold as he can possibly stuff inside them. The rubes were played for fools and we'll all have to suffer for it, some more than others.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: I don't know if your response will get through civility but let me respond in kind.\n\nYou call me a racist because you come from a biracial family. That doesn't mean you cannot be a racist. Do you know what the term Uncle Tom means? \n\nYou have no idea my race but judge me to be a white male simply because it fits your narrative.\n\nI watched the video, I didn't need some right wing talking head to explain to me what I should think. I do not need talk radio to tell me how to feel. I do not need my marching orders so I can troll boards with the same lame posts I see defending nazis everywhere on the net.\n\nYou claim you are not defending nazis but literally called me a racist because I watched your video and refuted it, and you didn't even refute the actually video, you refuted me not being told what I was seeing by a narrator. \n\nSorry, I can just watch the video without spin. If you need spin to tell you how a video goes down then you might just need to brush up on critical thinking 101.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Liberalism is a mental disorder!  Only White Western leftist hate their own race, color, country and flag.  This happens no where else on the planet.  Pretty simple!

Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: if   so  ,   then   that can  benefit   all  biological   males with   issues.  transitioning,  gay,   or straight. or  do   you  think it's only  a straight  white male  concern?\nquestion:   is  the   passage above  toxic?\nAnswer:",

No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south.

What's worse than \"playing the victim\" is being jealous of those who've actually been victims.  That's pretty much all your complaints amount to.  Shall I get out my harmonica and play you some \"white man's blues\"?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: For a developmental QB, the broken wrist isn't much, but I stand by the fact that his off field issues pushed him to be a 7th rounder more than his injuries.  No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: sorry,   i wasn't calling   you  a   hypocrite,   i'm  saying the   attitude  in  general  is hypocritical.   words,   actions   or   attitude can   be hypocritical\ni agree the   discrimination and  racism and all  that   crap   got   to  go. but   i've   a problem   wehn  i   see people  that  say   they're  victimized  against  (in  various  ways), then  turn  arund   and do  the same  exact thing  to someone   else  -   and   then attempt   to justify  their   actions.   or   on   a  different   angle,   when   ther police   are  trying  to  uphold the  laws,  then   the  police   themselves  screw   it  up  royally  and   break  the very  laws they're supposed to  uphold.  yes,  shootings  of unarmed   people   on  the   top  of   that  list,   and   it  has happened   here in  hawaii   numberous   times.\n\ni'm   curious   though  about   your   views   on   \"the  superior  white  man   situation.\"  just  because  someone   complains,   doesn't mean   they   think themselves   superior,  make  sure  you're not   \"projecting\"   on  them what  you   assume   they   think. it can   simply mean   they've   a different   world perspective of  things.\nquestion:  is  tghe   passage above   toxic?\nAnswer:",

        "prompt": "Passage: Making Sessions sound like the white version of Eric Holder or his replacement...Lynch.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Klansman, for us to understand one another you'll have to jettison concepts like 'passive racial reparations', 'making things even with everyone else' and other fallacies embraced by poor put-upon WWSSF (whiny white supremacist snowflakes) when they recount their imaginary \"slights\" at the merest positive mention of anyone else.  What's worse than \"playing the victim\" is being jealous of those who've actually been victims.  That's pretty much all your complaints amount to.  Shall I get out my harmonica and play you some \"white man's blues\"?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: For a developmental QB, the broken wrist isn't much, but I stand by the fact that his off field issues pushed him to be a 7th rounder more than his injuries.  No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: two   things   at  odds  with one  another.\n\nfirst, this  \"concern\"   over  the opioid epidemic  comes   from  the trump   base.  blue and white  collar  whites,   caught  up in   a spiral   of  addiction   that   started  when   their  health   insurance   payed   doctors started   handing   out   painkillers  to them like candy. \n\nsecond, unlike  the  drug  emergencies  perceived to  affect the  people   of   color in the   inner   cities,   this  one gets  treated  like   a   \"medical emergency\",   as  oppossed to   a   \"law enforcement\"  problem   - it clearly  being   the latter.   the dealers   just aren't  south   americans, mexicans or blacks. they're   corporate executives,  tie wearing drug   distributors,   doctors   and pharmacists.\n\nyes.  this is a  problem  that  needs to  be   addressed. just   like   cocaine.\n\nwhy  isnt  the   dea breaking down  the doors  of  corporate offices, dr.'s  offices,  and  pharmacies?  what's the   mandatory   sentencing   for  possession of   un-prescribed   painkillers? how   often are   the  feds   and   states   prosecuting for  opioids?\nquestion:   is the  passage above   toxic?\nAnswer:",

Pearl Harbor was a legitimate military target and so it was targeted.  Real men don't need safe spaces from bombings.  Real men take the bombing and then they return the favour tenfold.  When I read the sadsack comments on this board, I have to ask myself: where have all the real men gone?  Well, there's one coming to the White House in January.  Let's get our war on!\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: The league is made up of wealthy conservative white owners who r offended dat Colin Kaepernick would mount such a protest.  Obviously da owners also don't want to see ticket sales and revenues go downn - tho I doubt dis would b a long-term issue.

Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.?

No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south.

No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Aside from the subtle racist undertones, I can't help but think of our country's leader when the words \"white privilege\" are uttered or written.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

That's not what equality and liberty is about. That's not what MLK was marchin for. BLM is a fancy way of saying that black people will loose their minds if cops kill any blacks! But they can kill other races and they won't bat an eye for the loss. That's why BLM is a joke. Even if one time they would show support for a white death and protest the same way they do for would be criminals it would bring a little validity to their cause.

Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: yes, every right  thinking  person, man  & woman,   is offended by trumps   unconscionable comments.\n  but   we shouldn't  be  blinded   to  the   fact that  hilary   has  always   been  vulgar  in speech   &  action toward ther   secret  service   who   protect her  & to   others  - whom  she   sees  as less   than herself.  far  more important - that she  has  always   been  dangerously  dishonest   to the   point  of felonious  actions.   that vile   woman  &   her   groping,   philandering  husband went so   low  as  to  steal  white  house   furniture   - but had   to  return  most   of it &   pay  a   heavy   fine   - crimes, like so  many  of theirs  that  were   never  widely  publicized. her current  health status is  grave, but  not  reported.\n  our republi is in   serious   danger -   the national debt,  muslim threats, open   borders,   welfare  gone   wild,  bad  trade  deals,   the   new world order (or   disorder), ussupreme court  appointments, etc.  \n we   can't afford   to  allow   this  electon to go  to   the clinton  machine.\n vote not for   trump,  but  for   our   country.   mark the   ballot for trump.\nquestion:   is   the passage  above  toxic?\nAnswer:",

What's worse than \"playing the victim\" is being jealous of those who've actually been victims.  That's pretty much all your complaints amount to.  Shall I get out my harmonica and play you some \"white man's blues\"?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: For a developmental QB, the broken wrist isn't much, but I stand by the fact that his off field issues pushed him to be a 7th rounder more than his injuries.  No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south.

No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: i  agree.  white  supremacists are wrong.  howver  which group involved,  the   white  supremacists   or  the  counter   protesters, fully   complied with  the   law,   applied   for  and   were   granted a  permit  to   hold a  rally?   the   right  to free speech can   be   a  two  edged sword.   president trump  was  right   in   his initial   comment  that   there   were   twpo sides  to   blaim for   the  violence.\nquestion: is the   passage  above   toxic?\nAnswer:",

What's worse than \"playing the victim\" is being jealous of those who've actually been victims.  That's pretty much all your complaints amount to.  Shall I get out my harmonica and play you some \"white man's blues\"?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: For a developmental QB, the broken wrist isn't much, but I stand by the fact that his off field issues pushed him to be a 7th rounder more than his injuries.  No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Facebook Allowed Advertisers To Finishline \u2018Jew Haters\u2019.png\nTodayy, ProPublica published a bombshell report showin how Fb allowed advertisers to select anti-semitic categories to footlocker certain users.

No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Facebook Allowed Advertisers To Target \u2018Jew Haters\u2019.png\nToday, ProPublica published a bombshell report showing how Facebook allowed advertisers to select anti-semitic categories to target certain users. Facebook apparently has ad categories such as:\n*Jew Hater\n*How to burn Jews\n*History of why Jews ruin the world\nReally.\nWell, if you are trying to target groups of Nazis, White Nationalists or just super angry white guys who want to dress in matching polos and khakis while carrying tiki torches, you may want to select these categories. And Facebook is totally there for you!\nAt the end of the day, Facebook is a business and their product is YOU, the user. They will take any money they can from advertisers, because that is their business - selling access to you. So if you are a Nazi, they will market that. And to the right company/group/political candidate/hostile foreign government working on behalf of a political candidate, that is what they are looking for - Nazis.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Unspoken hatred chillin on da shoulders of dis fundamentalist White-hater.\nQuestion: Is da passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: to add  on  to   my   earlier comment, you   see white  criminals  as   bad,   but   in  a   way detached   from  their ethnicity.  because you're   white   you  reduce everyone else  down   to  nothing but   their  ethnicity,  denying   them the   free will and responsibility for  their actions  as individuals. tyhe're   de   facto representatives   of their   race   in  your   perspective.   so  yes  richard,   ytou're  a  racist   not  because you speak frankly about the news,  but because you can't   see  past  their   color   and  are  willing  to   blame   an entire population for   the  choices  of a  few   individuals.  you're   no better   than  blm protesters   who claim all  whites   are   racist   because  the   kkk exists, and actually  ytou're much  worse,   because   you're compounding  a false   narrative   of  white   superiority   that has   plagued   and   eaten  away at our   democracy   like a  cancer since  it's inception.\nquestion:  is the   passage above  toxic?\nAnswer:",

No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps.

What's worse than \"playing the victim\" is being jealous of those who've actually been victims.  That's pretty much all your complaints amount to.  Shall I get out my harmonica and play you some \"white man's blues\"?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: For a developmental QB, the broken wrist isn't much, but I stand by the fact that his off field issues pushed him to be a 7th rounder more than his injuries.  No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south.

You like it when people go onto private property to deface and remove statues?   You agreed with ESPN removing Robert Lee from UVa football games?  You have claimed in the past to be pro-free speech.   The removal of the removal of these statues is anti-free speech.    To me, memorials to Harvey Milk  and Stonewall Inn are memorials to hate and perversion and the rainbow flag is a hateful usurpation of a wonderful symbol, why can I not have them all removed?   Why is it only one form of hate that gets removed?   Why do we celebrate black racism and condemn white racism?  You do know that the slaves were handed to the slavers by other Africans, do you not?  That it was not just Europeans that were part of the slavery equation?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

Decency and character are reflected in what you do when you know that no one is looking.  Leadership is stepping forward FIRST and taking a public stand....even one which might be unpopular.  Trump tried to \"have it both ways\"......to mouth opposition to violence without condemning the purveyers of that racist hate and violence by name and, thereby, possibly alienating part of his base.  It didn't work real well as he was forced by a crescendo of public ourcry to do what he should have done \"on his own\".  Actions of character, dignity and courage come from within...Trump's belated acknowledgement of the hate purveyed by the ault-right, the white supremacists and the white nationalists came from pressure from the OUTSIDE.

No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south.

No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: How much government funding did white kids get in relation to blacks,indian and coloured kids ?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.?

No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: No one wants to stay the truth because it sounds like racism, but natives don't handle alcohol well.  That is not an insult, alcohol is not good for anyone.  If someone told me white people can't handle Meth I would not take that has racism, I would agree as it seems like most Meth heads are white.

Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.?

Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Cornwallis was involved in an alll out war witt tribes in Nova Scotia, he had orders to get da job done. Whites were bein killed by indigenous tribes and his retaliation, well bein a lil harsh was exactly wht the Mik Maq were doin to da British settlers. Dis group really needs to go bck and clean up their reserve, get jobs in da city, look after their families and pay taxes.

What's worse than \"playing the victim\" is being jealous of those who've actually been victims.  That's pretty much all your complaints amount to.  Shall I get out my harmonica and play you some \"white man's blues\"?\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: For a developmental QB, the broken wrist isn't much, but I stand by the fact that his off field issues pushed him to be a 7th rounder more than his injuries.  No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: From the obviously on purpose grainy picture.. looks like a white skinned black man.

No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps.

No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: George Soros is ONE billionaire in a Global Economy of White Imperialism.

No team would have been expecting him to do more than be on IR this year anyway, but his two injuries and his many off field issues made him a liability in most teams minds.\n\nAs for Elotro,I still say that his original post sounds derogatory to me, and not towards white people.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Amazing how you love throwing up Sharpville in white people's faces but omit to mention that the week before, seven policeman were butchered in Cato Manor Police Station in Durban under the exact same circumstances when they were instructed not to use force against a mob surrounding the police station.\nBut whilst we are on the Cato Manor saga why do we not see the Indian community commemorating the 1000 Indians that were slaughtered by blacks in the 1948 riots in Durban, which was repeated in Cato Manor in the late 1958/59 in which I distinctly remember as a young child seeing the Saracen armoured cars coming up Berea Road in Durban and the fact that my grandmother hid an Indian women and child in the back of the house because they were being attacked by blacks in Berea road itself.  Interesting how many Indians CEO's are involved in the Gupta saga with the latest replacement at Eskom being another Indian. \nYou are a hypocrite that just cant resist having a cheap shot at whites.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: True\n\nPassage: \"More dangerous\" here than in the U.S.? Not nearly, not if you count up the fatalities. Also \"out in the open\" in some states are firearms, that sure helps. Racism is often said to be more subtle in Canada, and I don't doubt it, but that is obviously the lesser of evils given the alternative to the south. Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: Mountain View still is a working-class neighborhood. The problem is that being working-class is no longer a guarantor of success, even if you own a business or work two or three jobs like many of these people do. There's also a huge disparity relative to skin tone, and you've unwittingly provided the reason for this, Dick.\n\nThese people move here, not for a paltry PFD as you assert, but for opportunity. Trust me, they understand finance better than you. Many of their children however see the barriers in place against them and act out.\n\nBy the way, one of the last high-profile Mountain View shootings was by a white kid raised by one of your conservative Christian buddies.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

Always to be a dreadful part of the human story, like tribalism, even as the best people work against it. \n(By the way, there's at least one very moving music video on youtube, Sam Cooke's original and still best 1964 version of his \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" with various newsreel scenes from the civil rights struggles of the time -- and the dignity is without exception with the black people not the white, how telling is that.)\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer: False\n\nPassage: I'm glad you heard it but if the picture painted is correct it seemed it was going to take a lot more than some therapy; I didn't hear any solution proposed.  Current crime rates etc in SA seem to support the view that whatever is being done is not working at all.\n\nAs regards \"whites\" I really personally think any thought, policy, philosophy that still insists on skin colour as a defining characteristic is doomed to fail; being just plain wrong in principle. SA is typical; does anyone seriously believe that in a country where the \"black\", 80% or more, majority have been in complete power (putting in place legislation etc that is used limit the power of other race groups) for more than 20 years that \"whites\" control anything significant?  It is a red herring distraction.\n\nMy take on Biko is that he advocated thinking people avoid being defined by anyone's skin colour. But I could easily be wrong which will be sad as I think skin colour should not define character or legal rights.\nQuestion: Is the passage above toxic?\nAnswer:",

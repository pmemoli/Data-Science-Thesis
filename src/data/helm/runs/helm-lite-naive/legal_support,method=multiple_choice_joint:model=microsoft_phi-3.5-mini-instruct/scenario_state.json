As noted by the New York Court of Appeals in Guard-Life, a claim of tortious interference with a voidable contract -- as opposed to an enforceable contract -- # should be treated the same as a tortious interference with business relations claim.\nA. \"[W]e are persuaded that interference with performance of voidable contracts should be treated the same as interference with contracts terminable at will for purposes of imposing liability in tort, and that both fall in the same category with interference with prospective contractual relations.\"\nB. \"[T]he existence of a valid, enforceable contract is a necessary predicate for a cause of action sounding in intentional interference with performance of a contract. However, recovery may nonetheless be had where, although the contract on which the plaintiff relies is voidable, the defendant has induced a party not to abide by its terms by means of fraud or other misconduct\" (citing Guard-Life \nAnswer:",

Union Carbide has acknowledged that \"[t]o the extent there are any cases where Conwed has paid claimants but not fully settled the existing injury,\" Conwed can recover future \"payable\" benefits for those workers if Conwed can provide sufficient evidence of the benefits it will have to pay. Based on our prior case law, we conclude that this is the correct result.\nA. holding that employer's insurer who provided workers' compensation benefits to employee but did not consent to employee's settlement with third-party tortfeasor may \"maintain an action for payments that become payable in the future\"\nB. holding that a trial court should calculate an employer's contribution due for the third party's future payments by using affidavits and other evidence to determine a lump sum amount and reduce the amount to its present value as of the date of the contribution judgment\nAnswer:",

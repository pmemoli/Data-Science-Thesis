5,False,"First, calculate the number of purple flowers. Since there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow ones, we multiply the number of yellow flowers (10) by 80% (0.80) and add that to the original number of yellow flowers:

Purple flowers: 10 + 8 = 18

Now, calculate the number of green flowers. There are 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers combined, so we first find the total number of yellow and purple flowers:

Yellow + Purple flowers: 10 + 18 = 28

Now find 25% of this total for the number of green flowers:

25% of 28 = 0.25 * 28 = 7

Finally, add the number of yellow, purple, and green flowers to find the total:

Yellow + Purple + Green = 10 + 18 + 7 = 35

Mark has a total of 35 flowers in his garden. The answer is 35.","There are 80/100 * 10 = <<80/100*10=8>>8 more purple flowers than yellow flowers.
So in Mark's garden, there are 10 + 8 = <<10+8=18>>18 purple flowers.

For the 2 hours of overtime each day, she earns 1.5 times her hourly wage, which is (1.5 x $18.00) = $27.00 per hour. So for the 10 hours of overtime she works in a day, she earns 10 x $27.00 = $270.00 per day.

Since she works 5 days a week, she will make $270.00 x 5 = $1350.00 in overtime.

In total, the number of people eaten by the monster over three hundred years is x + 2x + 4x = 7x.

We know that the monster has consumed 847 people in total, so we can set up an equation to solve for x:

7x = 847

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 7:

x = 847 / 7
x = 121

Therefore, there were 121 people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years. The answer is 121.","Let S be the number of people on the first hundred years’ ship.

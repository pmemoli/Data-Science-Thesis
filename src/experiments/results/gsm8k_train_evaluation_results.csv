0,False,"In April, Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends. In May, she sold half as many clips as April. So, in May, she sold 48 / 2 = 24 clips. The total number of clips Natalia sold in April and May is 48 + 24 = 72. The answer is 72.","Natalia sold 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 clips in May.
Natalia sold 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 clips altogether in April and May.

1,False,"Weng earns $12 per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour. To find out how much she earned for 50 minutes, we need to calculate the fraction of an hour: 50/60 = 5/6 of an hour. To find out how much she earned for 5/6 of an hour, we multiply her hourly rate by the fraction of the hour: $12 * 5/6 = $10. The answer is $10.","Weng earns 12/60 = $<<12/60=0.2>>0.2 per minute.
Working 50 minutes, she earned 0.2 x 50 = $<<0.2*50=10>>10.

2,False,"First, let's find out how much money Betty already has. Since she has half of the money she needs for the wallet, she has $100 / 2 = $50.

Her parents give her $15, and her grandparents give her twice as much as her parents, which means they give her 2 * $15 = $30.

Now, let's add the money given by her parents and grandparents to the amount she already has: $50 (already saved) + $15 (from parents) + $30 (from grandparents) = $50 + $15 + $30 = $95.

Since the wallet costs $100, Betty still needs $100 - $95 = $5 to buy the wallet.

The answer is $5.","In the beginning, Betty has only 100 / 2 = $<<100/2=50>>50.
Betty's grandparents gave her 15 * 2 = $<<15*2=30>>30.
This means, Betty needs 100 - 50 - 30 - 15 = $<<100-50-30-15=5>>5 more.

3,False,"Yesterday, Julie read 12 pages. Today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 pages. In total, she has read 12 + 24 = 36 pages. There are 120 - 36 = 84 pages left in the book. Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, which is 84 / 2 = 42 pages. The answer is 42.","Maila read 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 pages today.
So she was able to read a total of 12 + 24 = <<12+24=36>>36 pages since yesterday.
There are 120 - 36 = <<120-36=84>>84 pages left to be read.
Since she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, then she should read 84/2 = <<84/2=42>>42 pages.

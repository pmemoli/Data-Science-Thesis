0.4x = 0.25(x + 600)

Now, we'll solve for x:

0.4x = 0.25x + 150

Equating both expressions for cost of rent and utilities: 2p/5 = (p+$600)/4
Multiplying both sides of the equation by 20 gives 8p = 5p+$3000

A: If the 21st marble from the left and 23rd from the right are both the same color, it means there are 21 marbles to the left of it, plus 22 to its right, plus the marble in that position. So there are 21 + 22 + 1 = 44 marbles in total. The answer is 44.

Q: A pencil and a pen together cost $6.25. The pen costs $5.50 more than the pencil. How much is the pen?
A: Let's denote the cost of the pencil as ""P"" and the cost of the pen as ""P + $5.50."" We're given that P + (P + $5.50) = $6.25. Combining the terms gives us: 2P + $5.50 = $6.25. Subtracting $5.50 from both sides gives us: 2P = $6.25 - $5.50 = $0.75. Dividing by 2 gives us P = $0.375. So the pen costs $0.375 + $5.50 = $5.875. However, since the total cost was $6.25, we should round to the nearest cent to get $5.90 for the pen. The answer is $5.90.","We calculate first the discount: 80 * 45 / 100 = $<<80*45/100=36>>36

Ariella's account earns simple interest at a rate of 10% per annum. To calculate the interest earned after two years, we use the formula for simple interest: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time.

In this case, Principal = $600, Rate = 10% (or 0.10), and Time = 2 years.

Interest = 600 * 0.10 * 2 = $120.

Now, we add the interest to the initial amount in Ariella's son's savings account to find out how much money she'll have after two years:

Amount after two years = Initial amount + Interest
Amount after two years = 600 + 120 = $720.

For the 5-year payment plan:
Gary has $6,000 to repay, and he'll do it over 5 years, which is 5 * 12 = 60 months. To find the monthly payment, we'll divide the total amount by the number of months:

Now, to find the difference in spending between the two payment options, we'll subtract the 5-year plan monthly payment from the 2-year plan monthly payment:

We know that 1 orange costs $0.50, so the total cost of all oranges is 12 * $0.50 = $6.

Now we need to find the cost of the apples and watermelons. Let's denote the cost of 1 apple as A. Since you bought 12 apples, the total cost of apples is 12 * A.

2. B = 2F + 3 (Jim has 3 more than twice the number of Fords than Chevys)
3. F + C + B = 301 (Total models)

From 1 and 2, we have the following equations:
B - 4F = 0  ---- (Equation A)
B - 2F = 3  ---- (Equation B)

We can solve Equation A by adding 4F to both sides:
B = 4F

Then substitute B = 4F into Equation B:
4F - 2F = 3
2F = 3
F = 3/2 = 1.5 (As number of models can't be a fraction, let's round it to the nearest whole number)
F = 2

Now we know the number of Ford models, we can find the number of Buick models using B = 4F:
B = 4 * 2 = 8

Jim has 8 Buick models. The answer is 8.","Let x represent the number of Chevys

A: There are 3 gold coins and 7 silver coins. The total number of coins is 3 + 7 = 10. The probability of choosing a silver coin is the ratio of the number of silver coins to the total number of coins, so P(silver) = Number of silver coins / Total number of coins.

Q: In a group of 6 boys, their mean age is 10 years. Amongst these boys, two children are twins whose combined age is 20 years less than the combined age of the other four boys. What is the mean age of these four boys?

A: The mean age of 6 boys is 10 years, so the total age of the group is 6 x 10 = 60 years. The two twins' combined age is 20 years less than the other four boys' combined age. Let x be the total age of the four boys; then the combined age of the twins is x - 20. Since the total age of the group of boys is 60, we have x + (x - 20) = 60. Combining like terms, we get 2x - 20 = 60, then adding 20 to both sides yields 2x = 80. Dividing by 2, we find x = 40. The mean age of the four boys is therefore 40 / 4 = 10 years.

Next, let's find out the total weight of the 2 children. Their average weight is 64 pounds, so their total weight is 2 * 64 = 128 pounds.
Add the combined weight of the adults and children: 420 + 128 = 548 pounds.
The elevator's maximum weight is 600 pounds. To find the maximum weight of the next person, subtract the combined weight of the adults and children from the elevator's maximum weight: 600 - 548 = 52 pounds.
The maximum weight of the next person to get in the elevator without it being overloaded is 52 pounds.

Q: Three friends, Alex, Blake, and Casey, went out for a meal. Alex's meal costs $13, Blake's $19, and Casey's $16. They want to split the total bill evenly. How much does each person owe?
A: First, let's find out the total bill. Alex's meal costs $13, Blake's is $19, and Casey's is $16. So the total bill is 13 + 19 + 16 = $48.
Next, let's find out how to split the total bill evenly between Alex, Blake, and Casey. Since there are 3 people, each person owes $48 / 3 = $16.
The answer is that each person owes $16.

Q: A school ordered 1,000 boxed lunches for $5600. If the price of the lunches was first decreased by 48% and then increased by 76%, what was the final price of the boxed lunches?
A: First, let's find out the price of one boxed lunch by dividing the total cost by the number of lunches. $5600 for 1,000 boxed lunches means each lunch costs $5600 / 1,000 = $5.60.
Next, let's find out the new price after a 48% decrease. The decrease is 48% of $5.60, which is 0.48 * $5.60 = $2.688. The new price after the decrease is $5.60 - $2.688 = $2.912.
Now, let's find out the new price after a 76% increase. The increase is 76% of $2.912, which is 0.76 * $2.912 = $2.21232. The final price after the increase is $2.912 + $2.21232 = $5.12432.
The final price of the boxed lunches, after the decrease and increase, is $5.12432.","The sum of the weights of the three adults is 140 x 3 = <<140*3=420>>420 pounds.
The sum of the weight of the two children is 64 x 2 = <<64*2=128>>128 pounds.
So the total weight of the 5 people who are in the elevator is 420 + 128 = <<420+128=548>>548 pounds.
This would mean that the next person's weight must not exceed 600 - 548 = <<600-548=52>>52 pounds.

To find out how many cars he needs to sell each day to meet his quota, divide the number of cars left (23) by the number of days remaining (23). 23 ÷ 23 = 1.

For the second drink:
It has 2.5 times more caffeine per ounce (3 times more caffeinated than the first drink).

Each bag of feed costs $2, so Lao spends $2 on feed for each chicken he sells. To make $65 profit from selling chickens, Lao also makes $1.50 per chicken. Thus, the total amount he earns from selling a chicken is $1.50 (sale price) + $2 (cost of feed) = $3.50.

To find out how many chickens he sold, we need to divide his total profit by the profit per chicken. So, $65 (profit) / $3.50 (profit per chicken) = 18.57 chickens.

Timothy started with $50, so he has $50 - $36 = $14 left.

Next, we need to find out how much one set of key chains costs. 3 pieces cost $2, so one piece costs $2 / 3 ≈ $0.67.

With the remaining $14, Timothy can buy 14 / 0.67 ≈ 20.87 pieces of key chains. Since he can't buy a fraction of a key chain, he can buy 20 pieces of key chains. The answer is 20.","The two t-shirts amount to $8 x 2 = $<<8*2=16>>16.

- Cost of 6 T-shirts = 6 * $8 = $48

Next, let's calculate the sales tax:

- Sales tax = 0.05 * $480 = $24

Finally, let's add the sales tax to the total cost of the items:

His overtime wage is 1.5 his normal wage, or $12 * 1.5 = $<<12*1.5=18>>18 per hour.
So Gary worked $216 / $18 per hour = <<216/18=12>>12 hours' worth of overtime.

515,False,"First, let's determine the difference between the temperature (8 degrees) and the baseline temperature (32 degrees). The difference is 32 - 8 = 24 degrees.

Now, we need to calculate how many 3-degree increments are in a 24-degree decrease. We divide 24 by 3 to get 24 / 3 = 8 increments.

Since Annie's chances of skidding on ice increase by 5% for every 3-degree increment, we multiply the number of increments by the increase in percentage: 8 increments * 5% = 40%.

So, Annie has a 40% chance of skidding on ice when the temperature is 8 degrees. If she goes into a skid, there's a 40% chance she can regain control and avoid a serious accident.

To calculate the probability of a serious accident, we need to determine the chance that she doesn't regain control after skidding: 100% - 40% = 60%.

Finally, we need to multiply the chance of skidding (40%) by the chance of a serious accident after skidding (60%). 40% * 60% = 0.4 * 0.6 = 0.24 or 24%.

The percentage chance of Annie getting into a serious accident if she drives at 8 degrees is 24%.","First find how many degrees below 32 the temperature is: 32 degrees - 8 degrees = <<32-8=24>>24 degrees

Multiply the number of increases by 5% to find the total increase in skid risk: 8 * 5% = 40%
Now find the chance that Annie has a serious accident if she goes into a skid by subtracting the chance she regains control from 100%: 100% - 40% = 60%

We know that Merill has twice as many marbles as Elliot: M = 2E
We also know that together, Merill and Elliot have five fewer marbles than Selma: M + E = 50 - 5

Substitute the value of M from the first equation into the second equation:

2E + E = 50 - 5

Combine like terms:

3E = 45

Now, divide by 3 to find the number of marbles Elliot has:

E = 15

Now that we know how many marbles Elliot has, we can find the number of marbles Merill has using the first equation:

M = 2E

M = 2 * 15

M = 30

The answer is 30.","If Selma has fifty marbles, then Merill and Elliot together have 50-5 = <<50-5=45>>45 marbles.

Now, we can find P:
P = 0.1F
P = 0.1 * $90
P = $9

Finally, we can find the total monthly budget to pay all those expenses (F + H + P):
Total budget = F + H + P
Total budget = $90 + $150 + $9
Total budget = $249

The answer is 249.","Let x be Luna's house rental budget.
The total budget for house and food rental is represented by the equation x + (60x/100) = 240.
The equation becomes 100x + 60x = 24000 after multiplying each term by 100 to get rid of the fraction.
By combining like terms, the equation becomes 160x = 24000.
Thus, the value of x is 24000/160 = <<24000/160=150>>150 which represents the house rental budget.
So, Luna's food budget is $240 - $150 = $<<240-150=90>>90.
Her phone bill budget is $90 x 10/100 = $<<90*10/100=9>>9.
Therefore, Luna's monthly budget for all those expenses is $240 (house and food) + $9 (phone) = $<<240+9=249>>249.

Q: In three days, Mary will be four times as old as her daughter, Jane. Mary is currently 33 years old, and Jane is 5 years old. How old will Jane be in seven years from now?
A: Currently, Mary is 33 years old, and in three days, she will be 33 + 3/365 (since there are 365 days in a year). In three days, Mary's age will be:

33 + 3/365 = 33 + 0.008219 ≈ 33.008 years.

Now, let's solve for Jane's age in three days:

4 * 5.008 = 33.008 ≈ 20.032

Q: What is the result of the following arithmetic expression: $5 + 6^3 \times 2 - \frac{8}{4}$?
A: First, we calculate the exponents: $6^3 = 6 \times 6 \times 6 = 216$. Then, we multiply by 2: $216 \times 2 = 432$. Now we add 5: $5 + 432 = 437$. Next, divide 8 by 4: $8 \div 4 = 2$. Lastly, subtract this result from the former: $437 - 2 = 435$. The answer is 435.

A: Let's denote the number as x. According to the problem, the equation is $3x + 4 = 28$.

Q: If Sally has five more limes than three times the number of apples and she has 48 fruits in total, how many limes does Sally have?
A: Let's denote the number of apples Sally has as 'a.' Three times the number of apples is 3a. Since she has five more limes than that amount, she has 3a + 5 limes. The total number of fruits is 48. So, we can write an equation: a + (3a + 5) = 48. Simplifying, we get 4a + 5 = 48. Subtracting 5 from both sides, 4a = 43. Dividing by 4, a = 10.75, which does not make sense since you cannot have a fraction of an apple. 

Since the problem assumes whole fruits, we may have made a mistake. Upon closer examination, we realize Sally can have at most 15 apples because 15 * 3 would be 45, and 45 + 5 would be 50, which is less than 48. We made an error with the equation. It should be:

a + (3a + 5) = 48
4a + 5 = 48
4a = 43
a = 10.75

Since we cannot have 0.75 of an apple, the maximum whole number of apples she could have is 10. Hence she has 3*10 + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35 limes. The answer is 35.

Q: If I eat 2 candies every day for a week, and I have 74 candies in total, how many days are there in the week?
A: A week has 7 days. If you eat 2 candies every day, in a week you eat 2 * 7 = 14 candies. If you have a total of 74 candies and 14 are eaten in a week, you have 74 - 14 = 60 candies left. If you started with 74 candies and have 60 left after one week, the answer does not match the given condition. It's possible that you started with more than 74 or that some candies were not eaten.

658,True,"First, let's calculate the discount for each store:

First store:
6% of $950 = (6/100) * 950 = $57

Second store:
5% of €920 = (5/100) * 920 = €46

Now, let's calculate the price after the discount at each store:

First store:
$950 - $57 = $893

Second store:
€920 - €46 = €874

To find the difference in price, we'll first convert the prices to the same currency. Assuming a 1:1 conversion between dollars and euros, the difference is:

$893 - €874 = $893 - $874 = $19

The difference in price between the two stores is $19.


Q: James is preparing for a marathon with a training plan that includes 4 weeks of running on a track, 3 weeks on a treadmill, and then another 5 weeks of track training. Each week, he runs a 5-mile route around the track. His treadmill workout is set at the same pace as running on the track, but he prefers to walk an extra half a mile each treadmill session. Calculate the total miles James runs each week and the grand total for the duration of his training plan. Additionally, he rests every third day for 24 hours during the track weeks, missing those track days. Assume there are 7 days in a week.
A: First, we’ll calculate the total miles James runs each week on the track, taking into account he rests every third day:

Track days per week: 7 days - 2 days (resting every third day) = 5 days.
Miles per track day: 5 miles
Miles per week on track days: 5 miles/day * 5 days = 25 miles

Now, let’s add the extra half-mile during the treadmill sessions:

Treadmill miles per day: 5 miles + 0.5 miles = 5.5 miles

Treadmill days per week: 7 days - 2 days (resting every third day) = 5 days.
Miles per week on treadmill days: 5.5 miles/day * 5 days = 27.5 miles

Total miles James runs each week: 25 miles (track) + 27.5 miles (treadmill) = 52.5 miles

Now, for the grand total over the 12-week training plan:

Weeks of Track training: 4 weeks + 5 weeks = 9 weeks (with rest days)
Weeks of Treadmill training: 3 weeks

Miles for Track weeks: 25 miles/week * 9 weeks = 225 miles
Miles for Treadmill weeks: 27.5 miles/week * 3 weeks = 82.5 miles

Grand total miles over the training plan: 225 miles + 82.5 miles = 307.5 miles

James runs a total of 52.5 miles each week and runs 307.5 miles over the duration of his training plan.","The amount of discount in the first store 950 x 6/100 = $<<950*6/100=57>>57.

708,True,"Robi's 120-liter tub fills at 12 liters per minute when the water is running and loses 1 liter per minute when the water is off due to the cap's leakage. So effectively, when the water is on, it fills at a net rate of 12 - 1 = 11 liters per minute.

Since he is alternating one minute on and one minute off, each 2-minute cycle results in 11 liters of water added to the tub. We must determine how many cycles are required to fill the 120-liter tub.

To do this, divide the tub's capacity by the net fill rate for each cycle:

120 liters / 11 liters per cycle = 10.909 cycles (approximately).

Since Robi cannot have a fraction of a cycle, he needs at least 11 full cycles to fill the tub. Each cycle consists of 2 minutes, so it will take 11 cycles * 2 minutes per cycle = 22 minutes.

The answer is 22 minutes.","In 2 minutes, 12 liters of water flow into the bathtub and 2 liters (2 minutes x 1 liter/minute ) escape.
This will leave 12 – 2 = <<12-2=10>>10 liters of water every two minutes

Since Jake's snake is 12 inches longer than Jenny's snake, we can represent the length of Jake's snake as x + 12 inches.

Total earnings = (0.75x * 0.5) + (0.25x * 0.1)

We know that his total earnings are $40, so we set the equation:

40 = (0.375x) + (0.025x)

Now we'll solve for x:

40 = 0.4x

To find the value of x, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:

x = 40 / 0.4
x = 100

Q: In how many years will the number of dogs increase by 125%? 
A: Currently, there are 200 dogs. A 125% increase means there will be 100% (which is the current amount) + 125% (which is the increase) = 225% dogs in the future. This is equivalent to multiplying the current number of dogs by 2.25 (because 225% as a decimal is 2.25). So, we need to find x such that 200 * 2.25 = x. Solving for x, we get x = 200 * 2.25 = 450.

Context: In a class, 24 students like chocolate. The total number of students in the class is 30. 
A: Given that 24 students like chocolate and the total number of students is 30, we can find the number of students who do not like chocolate by subtracting the number of students who like chocolate from the total number of students. 30 - 24 equals 6.

Q: If Jill earns $8 per hour at her job and received a bonus of $84, what is the value of x if she wants to earn a total of $512 working for 36 hours, including the bonus?
A: Jill earns $8 per hour and wants to work for 36 hours. So, without the bonus, she will earn 8 * 36 = $288. With the bonus, she wants to earn a total of $512. The bonus is $84. So, the total amount she needs to earn from work is 512 - 84 = $428. Dividing 428 by her hourly rate of $8 will give us the number of hours she needs to work. 428 ÷ 8 = 53.5 hours. Since she only wants to work 36 hours and she will earn $288 in that time, she has already planned to work 53.5 - 36 = 17.5 more hours after earning the bonus. The answer is 17.5.

2. Each person contributes 3 gallons per mile, so 35 people x 3 gallons/person/mile = 105 gallons per mile for the passengers.
3. Each person brought 2 bags, so there are 2 bags x 35 people = 70 bags.
4. Each bag contributes 2 gallons per mile, so 70 bags x 2 gallons/bag/mile = 140 gallons per mile for the bags.
5. Therefore, the total additional fuel needed for people and bags is 105 gallons/mile (for people) + 140 gallons/mile (for bags) = 245 gallons/mile.

Now let's calculate the fuel needed for the empty plane:

1. The empty plane needs 20 gallons per mile.

Now, when her husband starts, he travels 20 miles in 5 miles (the distance Yolanda already traveled) and catches up with her. The relative speed between them (her husband's speed minus Yolanda's speed) is 40 mph - 20 mph = 20 mph.

To cover the same distance between them (5 miles) at a relative speed of 20 mph, it will take him 5 miles / 20 mph = 0.25 hours.

Now, convert 0.25 hours into minutes (0.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 15 minutes).

So, it will take him 15 minutes to catch up to Yolanda. The answer is 15.","Let x be the number of minutes it takes Yolanda's husband to catch her.
We know that Yolanda will spend a total of x + 15 minutes riding her bike since she left 15 minutes before her husband.

Yolanda's husband catches up to her when they've both traveled the same distance, which is when 20(x + 15) = 40x
We can simplify this equation by multiplying 20 through the parentheses to get 20x + 300 = 40x

Each customer buys 4 tomatoes at $0.5 per tomato, so each customer spends 4 * $0.5 = $2 on tomatoes. Since there are 500 customers, the total sales for tomatoes will be 500 * $2 = $1000.

Now, we'll add the sales of lettuce and tomatoes together to find the total sales:

Flour: Tom needs 500 pounds. Each bag of flour contains 50 pounds, so he needs 500 / 50 = 10 bags of flour. Each bag costs $20, so the total cost of flour is 10 * $20 = $200.

Salt: He needs 10 pounds of salt, and it costs $.2 per pound. The total cost of salt is 10 * $0.20 = $2.

Promotion: Tom spends $1000 promoting everything.

Now we'll sum up these costs: $200 (flour) + $2 (salt) + $1000 (promotion) = $1202 total cost.

Tom sells tickets for $20 each and sells 500 tickets. His total revenue is 500 * $20 = $10,000.

Now we'll calculate the profit he made by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $10,000 - $1202 = $8798.

The cost of the potatoes is 120 x $0.10 = $12.
The cost of the salt is 30 teaspoons / 5 teaspoons per container = 6 containers. So, the cost of the salt is 6 x $2 = $12.

Q: If Sally has five coins in her purse, and she buys a snack for $\$1.75$, how many coins will she have left?
A: First, we must convert the amount of $\$1.75$ into cents. To do this, we simply multiply by 100, since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents. $1.75 \times 100 = 175$ cents.

Now, we determine how many whole coins Sally needs to pay $\$1.75$. Since we know 1 coin is the smallest unit, Sally will need at least $\lceil 175 \div 1 \rceil$ = 175 coins. However, this is an overestimation since Sally only has 5 coins in her purse. 

So, let's divide $\$1.75$ by 1 coin (the smallest unit) first to determine how many times she can pay using one coin. $175 \div 1 = 175$. This means she can pay for $\lfloor 175 \rfloor = 175$ times using one coin.

Since Sally has 5 coins, she can only pay $\lfloor 175 \rfloor$ for each type of coin. However, if she splits the remaining payment evenly among the different coin types, she will be able to pay with the new amount. To find the remaining amount, we subtract the amount she can pay with five coins (5 * $100 = 500$) from $175$: $175 - 500 = -325$. Since this is a negative result, Sally will still be $325$ cents short. This means she would need to use additional coins to pay the complete amount. Since $\lfloor 325 \rfloor = 325$ cents, and all the coins in her purse are of the same unit, Sally would need to pay 7 more coins (325 / 45 = 7.22, rounded up to the nearest whole number).

Therefore, Sally will have 5 - 7 = $\boxed{-2}$ coins left, which is not possible. The question should be rephrased as:

Q: If Sally has five coins in her purse, and she buys a snack for $\$1.75$, how many coins will she need to pay for the snack?

Splitting the remaining payment evenly among the different coin types, we find that she will need 325 - (5 * 100) = 25 cents more. This means she will need to use 6 more coins (325 / 45 = 7.22, rounded up to the nearest whole number). 

Therefore, Sally will need a total of 5 + 6 = $\boxed{11}$ coins to pay for the snack.","Bucket B has 3 more fruits than C (which has 9 fruits) for a total of 9+3 = <<3+9=12>>12 fruits

A: The tennis club has 40 people, which is 100 - 44 = 56 people fewer than the chess club. The question states that these 56 people are in both clubs, so there are 56 people in both the chess club and the tennis club. The answer is 56.

Q: Two trains left Kanoa at the same time, one going North and one going south. If the northbound train left Kanoa traveling at an average speed of 80 km/h and traveled for 6 hours while the southbound train left traveling at an average speed of 60 km/h, what is the total distance between the two trains after 6 hours?
A: The northbound train traveled 80 km/h for 6 hours, so it covered 80 * 6 = 480 km. The southbound train traveled 60 km/h for 6 hours, so it covered 60 * 6 = 360 km. The total distance between the two trains is the sum of the distances each train traveled, which is 480 + 360 = 840 km. The answer is 840.

1. We are given that each dog has 4 legs.
2. We are given that 36 legs are tangled up in leashes.
3. We are told that there are 3 leashes tangled with Mariel's pack plus 1 leash with another walker's 3 dogs.

Now, let's start solving the problem using these pieces of information.

Mariel has x dogs in her pack. The number of leashes for her dogs plus the 3 extra leashes from the other walker is equal to the total number of leashes, so we have:
x dogs + 3 dogs = 4 leashes (for her dogs) + 3 leashes (for the other walker's dogs).

Since 4 legs are attached to each dog, the total number of legs from Mariel's dogs would be 4x. The 3 leashes with the other walker's 3 dogs contribute another 12 legs (3 dogs * 4 legs each).

According to the problem, 36 legs are tangled up in total. So we have:
4x legs (Mariel's dogs) + 12 legs (other walker's dogs) = 36 legs.

Now, let's solve for x.

4x + 12 = 36
4x = 36 - 12
4x = 24
x = 24 / 4
x = 6

Mariel is walking 6 dogs in her pack. The answer is 6.","There are 2 dog walkers and they each have 2 legs so that's 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 legs

The dog walkers have 4 legs and the other dogs have 12 legs for a total of 4+12 = <<4+12=16>>16 legs
There are 36 legs total and 16 belong to the dog walkers and 3 dogs so that leaves 36-16 = <<36-16=20>>20 legs

Q: In a toy store, a box containing 48 toy cars costs $60. If a shopkeeper decides to increase the price of each car by $1, what will be the new cost of the box?
A: The original price of the box is $60. If there are 48 toy cars in a box, the cost per toy car is $60 / 48 = $1.25 per car. If the price of each car is increased by $1, the new cost per car will be $1.25 + 1 = $2.25 per car. The new cost of the box would be 48 * $2.25 = $108.

His dad gave him an additional $10, so he now has $35d * 2 + $10. We know that he now has $500, so we can set up the equation:

35d * 2 + $10 = $500

First, we'll subtract the $10 from both sides:

35d * 2 = $500 - $10
35d * 2 = $490

Now, we'll divide both sides by 2 to find the number of days (d):

35d = $490 / 2
35d = $245

Finally, we'll divide both sides by $35 to find the number of days:

d = $245 / $35

1117,True,"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Gladys is 30 years old.
2. Billy is 3 times younger than Gladys, so Billy's age is 30/3 = 10 years old.
3. The sum of the ages of Billy and Lucas is: 30 (Gladys' age) - 10 (Billy's age) = 20.
4. Gladys' age is twice the sum of the ages of Billy and Lucas, so: 2 * 20 = 40 years old.

Now let's find out Lucas' age:
5. Since Gladys' age is 40 years, and she is twice the sum of Billy's and Lucas' ages, Lucas' age must be the remaining part of the sum (20 - 10). So Lucas is 20 - 10 = 10 years old now.

6. Three years from now, Lucas will be 10 + 3 = 13 years old.

The answer is Lucas will be 13 years old three years from now.","Billy's age is 30/3 = <<30/3=10>>10 years old.
The sum of the ages of Billy and Lucas is 30/2 = <<30/2=15>>15.

In a more advanced step-by-step explanation, let's break down the problem:

Step 1: Determine Betty's age.
We know Doug's age is 40, and the sum of their ages is 90.
Betty's age = 90 - Doug's age = 90 - 40 = 50 years old.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of one pack of nuts.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 20 packs.
Betty wants to buy 20 packs of nuts at 100 dollars per pack.

Q: A rectangle's length is 8 times its width. If the rectangle's width is increased by 7, the area will be tripled. What is the perimeter of the original rectangle?
A: Let the original width be 'w' and the length will then be '8w'. The area of the original rectangle is w * 8w = 8w^2. If the width is increased by 7, the new width becomes w + 7 and the new length will be 8w (because the length doesn't change). So, the new area will be (w + 7) * 8w = 8w^2 + 56w. As the new area is triple the original area, we have 3 * 8w^2 = 8w^2 + 56w, which simplifies to 24w^2 = 56w. Dividing by 'w' gives 24w = 56, so w = 56/24 = 7/3. The original width w is 7/3, and the original length l is 8 * (7/3) = 56/3. The perimeter of the rectangle is 2(l + w), which is 2 * ((56/3) + (7/3)) = 2 * (63/3) = 2 * 21 = 42.

Q: A cylindrical tower has a diameter of 10 meters and a height of 20 meters. If the height of the tower is doubled, what is the new volume of the cylinder?
A: Firstly, find the radius of the cylinder by halving the diameter. The radius is 10 meters / 2 = 5 meters.

The volume of a cylinder is calculated using the formula V = πr^2h, where 'V' is volume, 'π' is approximately 3.14159, 'r' is the radius, and 'h' is the height.

The original volume is:

Q: A farmer has a certain number of chickens (C) and cows (B) on his farm. Each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs. If there are 50 animals in total and there are 140 legs, how many chickens and cows are there?
A: We can create two equations from the given information:
1) C + B = 50 (total number of animals)
2) 2C + 4B = 140 (total number of legs)
We can simplify equation 2) by dividing by 2: C + 2B = 70.
Now we can subtract equation 1) from this new equation to eliminate C: (C + 2B) - (C + B) = 70 - 50, which gives us B = 20.

Based on the given information, we have two equations:

1. The total number of writing utensils: P + C = 108
2. The relationship between the number of pencils and pens: C = 5P + 12

Now let's solve these equations. First, substitute the value of C from equation (2) into equation (1):

P + (5P + 12) = 108

Now simplify and combine like terms:

6P + 12 = 108

Next, subtract 12 from both sides:

1385,True,"Cole needs to fence 3 sides. The two neighbor sides will each have half of their side and a third of the third side to be paid by the neighbors. Cole will pay for the remaining portion of the third side.

The length of the fence will be: 
- For the two sides with the neighbors (9 feet each): 9 feet.
- For the third side with the backyard (18 feet) he will pay 2/3 of it because the neighbor on the left agreed to pay for a third.

The cost of fencing for the two sides is:
9 feet x 3 dollars/foot = 27 dollars.

The cost of fencing for the third side is:
(18 feet x 2/3) x 3 dollars/foot = 36 dollars.

The total cost of the fencing is:
27 dollars + 36 dollars = 63 dollars.

The neighbor on the backside agrees to pay for half the cost of their shared side, which is 9/2 = 4.5 feet worth of fencing. The cost for the neighbor's half-side is:
4.5 feet x 3 dollars/foot = 13.5 dollars.

The neighbor on the left agrees to pay for a third of their shared side, which is 3/3 = 1 foot worth of fencing. The cost for the neighbor's third-side is:
1 foot x 3 dollars/foot = 3 dollars.

The total cost shared by the neighbors is:
13.5 dollars + 3 dollars = 16.5 dollars.

The total cost that Cole has to pay after the neighbors have paid their shares is:
63 dollars - 16.5 dollars = 46.5 dollars. The answer is 46.5.","Cole has to pay 3 * 9 = $<<3*9=27>>27 for one side of the side fence.
For the shared left fence, he has to pay two-thirds of 27, so he has to pay 27 * 2 / 3 = $<<27*2/3=18>>18.
The shared back fence will cost 3 * 18 = $<<3*18=54>>54.
He has to pay for half the back fence, so it will cost 54 / 2 = $<<54/2=27>>27.

1386,True,"First, let's calculate the total number of cars in the shop during the week. There are already 4 cars, and another 6 customers come in, making a total of 4 + 6 = 10 cars.

Now let's calculate the total number of tires needed for all the cars:

Each car has 4 tires, so for 10 cars, they would need 10 x 4 = 40 tires.

However, two customers only want half their tires changed, which means they each need 2 tires (half of 4). So for both customers, they need 2 x 2 = 4 tires together.

Now we subtract the tires needed for these two customers from the total number of tires:

40 (total tires for all cars) - 4 (tires for the two customers who only want half changed) = 36 tires needed for the remaining customers.

Since there are 20 tires left at the end of the week, we can calculate the number of cars that had their tires changed by subtracting the leftover tires from the tires needed for the remaining customers:

36 (needed tires) - 20 (leftover tires) = 16 tires were used.

Since each car uses 4 tires, we can find out how many cars had their tires changed:

16 (used tires) / 4 (tires per car) = 4 cars had their tires changed.

Now, we can calculate the number of customers who decided not to change their tires:

10 (total number of customers) - 4 (cars that had their tires changed) = 6 customers decided not to change their tires.

The answer is 6.","A total of 4 + 6 = <<4+6=10>>10 cars are in the shop throughout the week.
This means the shop buys 10 cars * 4 tires = <<10*4=40>>40 tires.
For each of the customers that only want half the tires changing, there are 4 tires * 0.5 = <<4*0.5=2>>2 tires left over.
Two of the customers only want half the tires changing, so there are 2 tires * 2 cars = <<2*2=4>>4 tires left over from these customers.
Out of the remaining tires, there are 20 – 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 tires left from customers who don't want their tires changing.
So in total, there were 16 tires / 4 tires per customer = <<16/4=4>>4 customers who did not want their tires changing.

Step 1: Lucy lost one-third of her money, leaving her with 2/3X.

Step 2: She then spent one-fourth of the remainder. So, she spent (1/4) * (2/3X) = 1/6X.

Step 3: After spending this portion, she is left with 2/3X - 1/6X = 1/2X, which equals $15 (given).

So, 1/2X = 15 and X = 15 * 2.

X = 30

The answer is 30.","The $15 is 1 - 1/4 = 3/4 of the money left.

So Lucy had $5 x 4 = $<<5*4=20>>20 left after losing 1/3 of her money.
Hence, $20 is 1 - 1/3 = 2/3 of the money that Lucy had at the beginning.
Since 2/3 is equal to $20, then 1/3 is equal to $20/2 = $10.
Therefore, Lucy had $10 x 3 = $<<10*3=30>>30 at the beginning.

In this case, we assume interest is compounded annually (n = 1), and the interest rate is 20% (0.20) for 3 years. So,

A = 10,000(1 + 0.20/1)^(1*3)

Cost for the new computer over 6 years: $100 per year x 6 years = $600.
Cost for the 2 used computers over 6 years: $133.33 per year x 6 years = $800 (approximately).

The cheaper option is the new computer, which costs $600 over 6 years. So, by choosing the cheaper option, James will save:

A:
To solve this problem, we'll begin by figuring out the total amount of apple juice in the 24 bottles. Since each bottle contains 250 ml of apple juice, 24 bottles would hold 24 * 250 ml = 6,000 ml of apple juice.

Since 1 cup can hold 250 ml of apple juice, you can divide the total volume of apple juice by the volume that 1 cup can hold to find out how many cups can be filled: 6,000 ml / 250 ml per cup = 24 cups.

Q: Mia ate a pack of potato chips and a pack of pretzels. The weight of a pack of potato chips is 1/4 times more than the weight of a pack of pretzels. Together, they weighed 116 grams. How much does a pack of pretzels weigh?
A: Let's call the weight of a pack of pretzels x grams. Therefore, the weight of a pack of potato chips is 1/4 times more than x, which is (1 + 1/4)x = 5/4x. 
We know the total weight of both is 116 grams. 
So we have x + 5/4x = 116. 
Combining like terms, we get 9/4x = 116. 
To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4/9. 
x = (4/9) * 116 = 52 grams.
The weight of a pack of pretzels is 52 grams.

On Wednesday, 3 students who were present on Tuesday were absent, leaving 13 - 3 = 10 students.

Q: A family went out to see a movie. The regular tickets cost $14 for adults and $8 for children. The family consisted of 2 adults and 3 children, so they spent $35 on tickets. They spent $140 on food. There was a $5 discount for the children's food. If they split the total cost of the trip equally between the 2 adults, how much money and tax did each adult pay if the sales tax was 10%?
A: The family consists of 2 adults and 3 children, spending $35 on tickets. This means they spent $17.5 per adult and $8 per child.
The total cost for the tickets was $35 and they spent $140 on food.
The total cost for both the tickets and food is $35 + $140 = $175.
If there was a $5 discount for the children's food, then the discounted cost for the food is $140 - $5 = $135.
The total cost of the trip, including the discounted food, is $175 - $5 = $170.
If this total cost is split equally between the 2 adults, each adult pays $170 / 2 = $85.
Since the sales tax is 10%, the total cost for each adult, including tax, is $85 + (10% of $85) = $85 + $8.5 = $93.5.
The answer is $93.50.

Q: There are 24 students in a class. If three students are selected at random to give a presentation, what's the probability that John and Alice will be two of the students chosen?
A: To calculate the probability that John and Alice will be two of the three chosen students, we can use the combination formula. There are a total of 24 students, and we need to choose 3 students. The number of ways to choose 3 students from 24 is given by the combination formula:

C(24, 3) = 24! / (3!(24-3)!) = (24 x 23 x 22) / (3 x 2 x 1) = 2024

Now, to ensure John and Alice are both chosen, we need to select one more student from the remaining 22 students. There are 22 ways to choose one student from 22 students. Therefore, the number of ways to choose a set with John and Alice is 22. The probability of choosing John and Alice, along with one other student is:

P(John and Alice chosen) = Number of ways they can be chosen / Total number of ways to choose any 3 students

Since Brent has 1 more mistake than Leo, Brent's mistakes are x + 1. Since Brent scored 25 and has a mistake that affects his score, his score must be 25 - (x + 1).

Now, we know the total mistakes made by Leo, Brent, and Madeline sum up to the total number of mistakes they made. So, x (Leo's mistakes) + x + 1 (Brent's mistakes) + 2 (Madeline's mistakes) = 6 (total mistakes). Combining the x terms, we get 2x + 1 + 2 = 6, so 2x = 6 - 3 = 3, and x = 3 / 2 = 1.5.

However, since mistakes have to be a whole number, x must be a whole number and the closest whole number to 1.5 would be 1 or 2.

Q: In an art competition, there were 8 judges who gave 5 points, 10 judges who gave 4 points, and 6 judges who gave 3 points. If there are no other scores, what is the average score given by the judges?
A: To find the average score, we need to find the total number of points given by the judges and then divide that by the total number of judges.

First, we calculate the total points by multiplying the number of judges by the points they gave:
- 8 judges gave 5 points each: 8 x 5 = 40 points
- 10 judges gave 4 points each: 10 x 4 = 40 points
- 6 judges gave 3 points each: 6 x 3 = 18 points

Now, we add the total points together: 40 + 40 + 18 = 98 points in total.

Next, we calculate the total number of judges: 8 + 10 + 6 = 24 judges.

Finally, we divide the total points by the number of judges to find the average: 98 / 24 = 4.0833.

Round to two decimal places: 4.0833 rounded to two decimal places is 4.08.

The average score given by the judges is 4.08. The answer is 4.08.


Q: A bakery sells muffins in packs and individual packs. On Monday, they sold 12 packs with 6 muffins each. On Tuesday, they sold twice as many individual muffins as they did packs, and on Wednesday, they sold packs and individual muffins in a 3:1 ratio. If they sold a total of 204 packs throughout the three days, how many muffins did they sell in total?
A: 
To solve this problem, let's calculate the number of packs sold each day and then determine the total number of individual muffins sold.

On Monday, they sold 12 packs. That's 12 x 6 muffins = 72 muffins.

Let's say the number of packs sold on Tuesday is x. They sold twice as many individual muffins as they did packs, so they sold 2x individual muffins. 

On Wednesday, they sold packs and individual muffins in a 3:1 ratio. The total number of packs sold on Wednesday can be represented as y. Thus, the number of individual muffins is y/3.

The total packs sold over the three days is 204, and we know 12 were sold on Monday, so we have 204 - 12 = 192 packs to account for on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The sum of the individual muffins sold on Tuesday and Wednesday should equal the total number of individual muffins sold:
2x (Tuesday) + y/3 (Wednesday) = 2x + y/3.

Since the total sold includes both packs and individual muffins and we already have the number of packs sold, the equation will be:
x (Tuesday's packs) + y (Wednesday's packs) = 192.

From the ratio on Wednesday (3 packs for every individual muffin), we know that 3y individual muffins are sold for every 1y","First find the total number of children: 6 kids + 9 kids + 5 kids = <<6+9+5=20>>20 kids

So, in total, the partially filled tires need 300 + 150 = 450 cubic inches of air.

Now add the air needed for the flat tires to the air needed for the partially filled tires: 1000 + 450 = 1450 cubic inches.

Q: A school is organizing their annual sports day event. There are 24 students available for soccer, basketball, and baseball teams. Each team must have at least 4 students. The soccer team needs twice as many students as the basketball team, and the baseball team needs one less student than the basketball team. How many students should be allocated to each team to have the most even distribution possible?
A: Let's denote the number of students in the basketball team as B. According to the problem, the soccer team needs twice as many students as the basketball team, so the soccer team has 2B students. The baseball team needs one less student than the basketball team, so the baseball team has B - 1 students.

The total number of students in all three teams is 24:
B (basketball) + 2B (soccer) + (B - 1) (baseball) = 24

Now, let's solve this equation:
4B - 1 = 24
4B = 25
B = 25 ÷ 4

Since we cannot have a fraction of a student, let's find the nearest whole number that B could be while still maintaining the conditions. B could be either 6 or 7 (since 6 is 4 times 1, and 7 is 4 times 1 plus an extra student).

If B = 6, then the soccer team would have 2B = 12 students, and the baseball team would have B - 1 = 5 students. This would account for:
6 (basketball) + 12 (soccer) + 5 (baseball) = 23 students, which is one less than 24.

If B = 7, then the soccer team would have 2B = 14 students, and the baseball team would have B - 1 = 6 students. This would account for:
7 (basketball) + 14 (soccer) + 6 (baseball) = 27 students, which is three more than 24.

In this case, allocating 7 students to the basketball team allows us to assign whole numbers to the other teams, with the soccer team having twice as many students (14), and the baseball team having one less student than the basketball team (6). So, with these allocations, each team has:
Soccer team: 14","Since a dozen is equal to 12, then Jason bought 12 x 4 = <<12*4=48>>48 cupcakes.

Q: Mick is two years old. Each year, the ratio of his age to Jill's age will be 2:1. Currently, Jill is 15 years old. In what year will Mick be 11 years old?
A: Currently, the ratio of Mick's age (2 years old) to Jill's age (15 years old) should already be 2:1, but since we're talking about future ages, we'll assume you have overlooked that and proceed with the calculation as follows: If Mick is 2 years old, and the ratio is to be 2:1 when he is 11, then Jill will be 11 / 2 = 5.5 years old. However, since ages are typically whole numbers, let's assume the ratio will be 1:1 when he's 11. That means in 11 - 2 = 9 years, when Mick is 11, Jill will be 15 + 9 = 24 years old.

Since Ishaan is 7 years older than Umaima, we can say Ishaan's current age is x + 7, and thus y is x + 5. Substituting, we get (x + 7) + 2 = 5 * (x + 5 - 2), which simplifies to x + 9 = 5x + 25 - 10.

The total weight that each truck can carry is 2,000 pounds. There are 3 trucks, so the total weight that can be carried per delivery is 3 * 2,000 = 6,000 pounds.

The total weight of the lighter and heavier boxes is 10x + 40y. Since x = y, we can rewrite this as 10x + 40x = 50x.

x ≤ 120 (dividing both sides by 50)

Since x represents the number of boxes of lighter products and y represents the number of boxes of heavier products, and x = y, we have:

Let the time taken by Rickey to finish the race be T1 and the time taken by Prejean be T2. We know that T1 + T2 = 70 minutes.

Also, we know that time taken is inversely proportional to the speed. So, T1/P = T2/R

1966,True,"Selina has $30 after buying the $10 each shirts. Let's denote the number of shirts she sold as S.

She bought 2 shirts at $10 each, which cost her $20. So, the money she earned from selling shirts and the money she received as change should be equal to her initial amount minus the $20 she spent on buying shirts.

She earned $20 from selling shirts, and she left the store with $30, so she must have received $30 - $20 = $10 from selling shirts.

Let's now find out how much money she earned from selling pants and shorts:
- She sold 3 pairs of pants at $5 each, earning her $5 * 3 = $15.
- She sold 5 pairs of shorts at $3 each, earning her $3 * 5 = $15.

Adding together the money earned from pants and shorts gives us $15 + $15 = $30.

Now, we already know she earned $10 from selling shirts, so the total money from selling pants, shorts, and shirts should be equal to the $30 she received as change.

Subtracting the $10 earned from selling shirts from the total amount, $30, gives us $30 - $10 = $20 earned from selling pants and shorts.

We've already calculated that she earned $30 from selling pants and shorts. So, since $20 came from selling pants and shorts, we know that $10 must have come from selling shirts.

To find out how many shirts she sold, we can divide the money she earned from shirts ($10) by the price of each shirt ($4).

$10 ÷ $4 = 2.5

Q: A rectangle has a length that's twice its width. The width is 3 units. Calculate the area and find out how many unit cubes could fit inside the rectangle.

A: First, calculate the rectangle's length, which is twice its width. Since the width is given as 3 units, the length would be 2 x 3 units = 6 units.

Now, to find the area of the rectangle, multiply the length by the width.
Area = length x width
Area = 6 units x 3 units
Area = 18 square units

As each unit cube occupies a 1x1x1 volume, you can fit 18 unit cubes inside the rectangle because the area of the rectangle is 18 square units.

Q: An aquarium is 5 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 1 foot tall. If it is filled to the top, calculate the volume of water in gallons. (1 cubic foot = 7.48052 gallons)

A: First, calculate the volume of the aquarium in cubic feet using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:
Volume = length × width × height
Volume = 5 feet × 2 feet × 1 foot
Volume = 10 cubic feet

Next, convert the volume in cubic feet to gallons using the conversion factor provided:
Volume in gallons = 10 cubic feet × 7.48052 gallons/cubic foot
Volume in gallons = 74.8052 gallons

So, the volume of the water in the aquarium when it is filled to the top is 74.8052 gallons.

A: The rectangular box can hold 50 * 40 * 21 = 42,000 cm³ of matchboxes. If each matchbox has a base measuring 3 cm by 7 cm, its volume is 3 * 7 * h = 21h cm³, where h is the height.

A: There are 26 students in the red house, 26 in the blue house, 34 in the green house, and 28 in the yellow house. So, the total number of students is 26 + 26 + 34 + 28 = 114. The answer is 114.

Q: On Monday, there were 56 people in a stadium. On Tuesday, 40% of the people from Monday attended. On Wednesday, more people attended than on Tuesday. On Thursday, 31 people attended. On Friday, 15 people attended. A total of 980 people attended the stadium during these five days. How many more people attended on Wednesday than on Tuesday?
A: On Monday, there were 56 people. On Tuesday, 40% attended, so there were 56 x 0.4 = 22.4, rounded to 22 people. Since on Thursday there were 31 people and on Friday there were 15 people, that's 31 + 15 = 46 people over Thursday and Friday combined. Now we have a total of 56 (Monday) + 22 (Tuesday) + 46 (Thursday and Friday) = 124 people accounted for. 980 - 124 gives us 856 people for Wednesday. The answer is 856 - 22 = 834 people more on Wednesday than on Tuesday.

Q: In a class of 100 students, each student gets a score between 1 and 100 (both inclusive). Each possible score from 1 to 100 is given to at least one student, and no two students have the same score. The average (mean) score of the students is 53.5. Given these conditions, find the smallest possible value of the score that one of the students gets.
A: Given that no two students have the same score and every possible score from 1 to 100 has been given, we need to find the arrangement of scores such that the average is 53.5. This means the total score sum should be 53.5 * 100 = 5350. To maximize the score of the highest scoring student (which would minimize the scores of other students and hence find the minimum score given to one student), we can give the first 99 students scores from 1 to 99 in ascending order. This adds up to a sum of 99 * (99+1)/2 = 4950. The remaining score for the 100th student is then 5350 - 4950 = 400. The smallest possible value of the score that one of the students gets is 1.

Q: A shopkeeper has a shelf with 10 slots. He has 10 differently-colored balls and wants to place them on the shelf such that no two same-colored balls are next to each other. Find the smallest possible value of the total number of arrangements the shopkeeper can make.

Q: A rectangle has dimensions (x + 3) units by (2x – 5) units. If the area is 84 sq. units, what is the value of x?
A: The area of a rectangle is length times width, so for this rectangle (x + 3) * (2x – 5) = 84.
Expand the equation: x(2x) + 3(2x) - 5(x) - 5(3) = 84.
Simplify and combine like terms: 2x^2 + 6x - 5x - 15 = 84.
Combine like terms further: 2x^2 + x - 99 = 0.
To find the value of x, we can use the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a).
In this case, a = 2, b = 1, and c = -99.
Using the quadratic formula: x = (-1 ± √(1^2 - 4*2*(-99))) / (2*2)
Simplifying further: x = (-1 ± √(1 + 792)) / 4
x = (-1 ± √793) / 4
So, x ≈ (-1 + √793) / 4 or x ≈ (-1 - √793) / 4
The value of x can be either (-1 + √793) / 4 or (-1 - √793) / 4. The answer is either (-1 + √793) / 4 or (-1 - √793) / 4.

Q: The ratio of male to female college students in the U.S. is 4:5. If there are 884,200 male students, how many female students are there?
A: Let x be the number of female students.
The ratio of male to female students is 4:5. We can write this as 4/5 = 884,200 / x.
To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 4x = 5 * 884,200.
4x = 4421000, so x = 4421000 / 4 = 1,105,250.

2129,False,"First, let's find out how much the farmer earned from selling 5 chickens. Each chicken costs $8, so 5 chickens cost 5 * 8 = $40.

Let's call the number of ducks sold d. Each duck costs $10, so the total earnings from ducks would be 10d. The total earnings from both ducks and chickens would be 10d + 40.

The farmer spends half his earnings on a new wheelbarrow, so the cost of the wheelbarrow is (10d + 40)/2.

Since the person who sees the wheelbarrow pays double what the farmer paid and the farmer earns another $60, we can set up the following equation:

2 * (10d + 40)/2 = 60

Now, let's simplify and solve for d:

10d + 40 = 60

Q: Alice has decided to paint her rectangular house. The paint has a volume of 280 milliliters per square meter, and Alice's paint store charges $50 per 10 liters. If she needs to cover 300 square meters, how much will the paint cost in total?
A: First, we must determine how many liters of paint Alice needs. Alice needs to cover 300 square meters, with a volume of 280 milliliters per square meter. This is a total volume required: 

300 square meters * 280 milliliters/square meter = 84,000 milliliters
Since there are 1,000 milliliters in a liter, this can be converted to:

84,000 milliliters / 1,000 = 84 liters

Alice will pay $50 for every 10 liters. We calculate how many 10-liter packs she needs:

84 liters / 10 liters/pack = 8.4 packs
Since we cannot buy a fraction of a pack, Alice will need to purchase 9 packs.

Total cost will be:
9 packs * $50/pack = $450
So, the paint will cost Alice $450 in total.

Q: A rectangular field has a length of 60 meters and a width of 40 meters. The farmer wants to build a fence around the field. The cost of fencing is $20 per meter for the length sides and $15 per meter for the width sides. What will be the total cost of fencing the field?
A: To calculate the total cost, we must first find the perimeter of the field, which is the sum of all four sides. The perimeter P is given by:
P = 2 * (length + width)
P = 2 * (60 meters + 40 meters) = 2 * 100 meters = 200 meters

Next, we calculate the cost of fencing for the length sides:
60 meters * 2 (for both length sides) * $20/meter = 120 meters * $20/meter = $2,400

Then, we calculate the cost for the width sides:
40 meters * 2 (for both width sides) * $15/meter = 80 meters * $15/meter = $1,200

Adding both costs together gives us the total cost for fencing:
$2,400 (length sides) + $1,200 (width sides) = $3,600
The total cost of fencing the field is $3,600.

A: Let the width of the rectangular field be x meters. Since the field's length is three times its width, the length will be 3x meters. The field area F is then given by:
F = width * length
F = x * 3x = 3x^2

If we don't know the exact number of days, let's assume she babysits for d days. Her total earnings from babysitting can be calculated as (3 hours/day) * ($10/hour) * d days = $30d.

Now, let's determine how much money Susie spent on the make-up set. She spent 3/10 of her earnings, which is (3/10) * $30d = $9d.

Next, we need to find out how much money Susie spent on her skincare products. She spent 2/5 of her earnings, which is (2/5) * $30d = $12d.

Now, let's calculate how much money Susie has left after buying the make-up set and skincare products. Total earnings = $30d. Amount spent on make-up set = $9d. Amount spent on skincare products = $12d. So the remaining amount is (Total earnings) - (Amount spent on make-up set + Amount spent on skincare products) = $30d - ($9d + $12d) = $30d - $21d = $9d.

Therefore, Susie has $9d left from her earnings last week, where d represents the number of days she babysat.","Susie earned $10 x 3 = $<<10*3=30>>30 per day.

Now, we need to figure out how long it will take for Darrel to catch up to the coyote. We'll use the formula: time = distance / speed.

In this case, the distance between them is 15 miles (the distance the coyote has traveled), and the relative speed is 15 miles per hour. So, the time it will take for Darrel to catch up to the coyote is 15 miles / 15 miles per hour = 1 hour.

And the distance the coyote travels is defined as the length of time the coyote travels (x+1 hour) and the coyote's speed (15 mph), or the expression (x+1)*1.
And since the distance Darrel and the coyote travel is the same, then 2*x=(x+1)*1

2275,True,"There are 6 apples initially. Let 'x' represent the number of apples Mary ate. After she ate 'x' apples, she would have 6 - x apples left. She plants two trees for each apple she ate, so 2x trees will be planted. Since we know that she ate some apples, we can't have 6 - x = 0, as there are at least 2 trees planted.

So, we have the following inequality: 0 < 6 - x < 6. To solve this, we need to isolate 'x':

0 < 6 - x < 6
Add 'x' to all sides: x < 6 + x - x
Simplify: 0 < 6

Since this statement is always true (0 is always less than 6), we can conclude that Mary can eat any non-negative number of apples. However, since the question probably intends for us to determine how many whole apples Mary ate (as you can't really eat a fraction of an apple in this context), we would need more information to find the exact number. Therefore, the question cannot be answered with the information given.","She planted eight trees.

Each 60-minute walk takes up 60 minutes, so Johnny can walk 240 / 60 = 4 dogs in 60-minute walks per day.

Since each of the 6 dogs needs a 60-minute walk, Johnny will walk them all in a single walk (as 6 <= 4 * 3 = 12 dogs, and he can walk 12 dogs in a single 60-minute walk). He gets $20 for each 60-minute walk.

Now let's find out how many dogs he can walk in 30-minute walks. He still has 4 hours - 1 hour (60 minutes) for each dog, which is 3 hours or 180 minutes. He can walk 180 / 30 = 6 dogs in 30-minute walks per day.

As he can walk 3 dogs at once, he can walk 6 / 3 = 2 sets of 30-minute walks. He receives $15 for each 30-minute walk, so he earns 2 * $15 = $30 from 30-minute walks per day.

Now we can add the earnings from both types of walks:
$20 (60-minute walks) + $30 (30-minute walks) = $50 per day.

Finally, we can calculate the weekly earnings by multiplying daily earnings by the number of days worked:
$50 per day * 5 days = $250 per week.

The answer is $250.","Johnny spends 6/3=2 hours walking the 6 dogs who have 60-minute walks.
He makes $20*6=$<<20*6=120>>120 for these walks.
Thus, he has 4-2=2 hours=120 minutes left to walk the other dogs.
He can walk 3*(120/30)=<<3*(120/30)=12>>12 dogs in this time.

To calculate how much money Michael will have left after his purchases, we can subtract the total cost of the items from his initial amount:

4 pizzas * 8 slices each = 32 slices.

Each friend gets 2 slices:

5 friends * 2 slices each = 10 slices.

To find out if there are any slices left, we subtract the total slices given to the friends from the total available slices:

32 total slices - 10 slices given out = 22 slices left.

After everyone gets their share, there will be 22 slices left over. 


","They are to order a total of 3 burger meals and 3 sodas for Paulo and Jeremy.
The cost of a soda is $6/3 = $<<6/3=2>>2.
So, the 3 sodas will amount to $2/soda x 3 sodas = $<<2*3=6>>6.

A standard deck has 52 cards. Face cards are the Jack, Queen, and King of each suit. There are 4 suits, so there are 12 face cards in total. Also, we remove all the 8's, which are 4 cards in total.

Number of original cards = 52
Number of cards removed (face cards + 8's) = 12 + 4 = 16

First, let's convert the bald eagle's dive speed from miles per hour to miles per second: 100 miles/hour * (1 hour/3600 seconds) = 100/3600 miles/second ≈ 0.0277 miles/second.

2 farms × 2 horses per farm = 4 horses
2 stables × 5 horses per stable = 10 horses

Total horses = 4 + 10 = 14 horses

Each horse has 4 horseshoes, so the total number of horseshoes needed is:

14 horses × 4 horseshoes per horse = 56 horseshoes

Since each horseshoe requires 2 kg of iron, the total amount of iron needed is:

The blacksmith starts with 400 kg of iron and needs 112 kg to fulfill the orders for farms and stables. This leaves him with:

Now, we can calculate how many horseshoes the blacksmith can make with the remaining iron:

288 kg ÷ 2 kg per horseshoe = 144 horseshoes

Since each horse has 4 horseshoes, the total number of horses that can be supplied with new horseshoes from the blacksmith is:

Q: In the morning, Emily rode her bike at 6 kilometers per hour, and in the afternoon she rode at 12 kilometers per hour. If she traveled a total of 12 kilometers in 1 hour, how many hours did she travel for each speed?
A: Emily's total distance traveled was 12 kilometers. She traveled at two different speeds: 6 kilometers per hour in the morning and 12 kilometers per hour in the afternoon. Let's denote the time she traveled at 6 km/h as 't' hours. Then, the distance she covered at this speed is 6t km.

Since she traveled a total of 12 kilometers, and we know the second part of her trip, we can say:

6t + 12 = 12 (total distance)

6t + 12 = 12

Subtract 12 from both sides to solve for 't':

6t = 12 - 12

6t = 0

Now, divide by 6 to solve for 't':

t = 0 / 6

t = 0 hours at the morning speed.

Now using her afternoon speed:

Total travel time = Time in the morning + Time in the afternoon

Since she didn't travel at 6 km/h in the morning, all 1 hour was at 12 km/h. Therefore:

Time at 12 km/h = 1 hour

So, Emily did not travel in the morning, and she spent 1 hour traveling in the afternoon. The answer is 0 (for morning) and 1 (for afternoon).","The school band earned $10/family * 3 families = $<<10*3=30>>30 from three families.

Since she made $600 from babysitting Zachary, and she babysat him at a rate of $600 per babysitting, we need to find out how many times she babysat him: $600 / rate per babysitting. Since the rate is not given, let's assume it's $100 per babysitting (this assumption can be adjusted based on additional information). Thus, she babysat Zachary 6 times.

Now, since she babysat Zachary three times as often as Julie, she babysat Julie 6 / 3 = 2 times. Finally, since the number of times she babysat Zachary was 1/5 the number of times she babysat Chloe, she babysat Chloe 6 * 5 = 30 times.

To find out how much Zoe made from babysitting Julie, we need the rate per babysitting. Let's assume it's also $100 per babysitting. So, she made $100 * 2 = $200 from babysitting Julie.

Now we can calculate the total earnings from babysitting:
$600 (Zachary) + $200 (Julie) + (unknown earnings from Chloe) = Total babysitting earnings

Since she made a total of $8,000, we can now find out how much she earned from pool cleaning:
Total earnings - Total babysitting earnings = Pool cleaning earnings

However, we need the information on how much she made from babysitting Chloe. We can assume the rate for Chloe (since it's not given) should be $100 per babysitting for the sake of this problem. So Zoe made $100 * 30 = $3,000 from babysitting Chloe.

Now we can calculate the pool cleaning earnings:
$8,000 - ($600 + $200 + $3,000) = $8,000 - $4,800 = $3,200

The answer is $3,200.","From babysitting Julie, Zoe made 3 * 600 = <<3*600=1800>>1800 dollars, since she made $600 babysitting Zachary and she babysat Julie three times as often

Q: The local library is hosting a book donation drive. For every 3 paperback novels donated, 5 hardcover books are donated. If by the end of the week, the library receives a total of 75 books, with the ratio of paperback to hardcover books being 2:3 and 10 books were damaged and discarded, how many paperback novels were donated?

A: Let \( p \) be the number of paperbacks and \( h \) be the number of hardcovers. The total number of books donated initially is \( p + h \), but after discarding damaged books, this becomes \( p + h - 10 \).

From the problem statement:
- The ratio of paperbacks to hardcovers is 2:3, so \( \frac{p}{h} = \frac{2}{3} \).
- Total books after discarding damaged ones: \( p + h = 75 + 10 = 85 \).

Now set up a system of equations:

1) \( p + h = 85 \)
2) \( \frac{p}{h} = \frac{2}{3} \)

From equation 2:
\( 3p = 2h \)

Substitute \( p \) from equation 1:
\( 3(h - h/3) = 2h \)
\( 3h - h = 2h \)
\( h = 3h - 3h \)

So we find that \( h = 3h/3 \), and thus \( h = 85/3 \).

Now solve for \( h \):
\( h = 28 \) (since it must be a whole number as per the context of the question)

Substitute \( h \) into equation 1:
\( p + 28 = 85 \)
\( p = 85 - 28 \)
\( p = 57 \)

Q: On Monday, a bakery sold 180 vanilla cupcakes. On Tuesday, the bakery sold 50% more blueberry cupcakes than vanilla cupcakes in the first half of the day.

Q: 36 men can complete a job in 20 days. After 13 days, 9 men leave. How many more days are required to complete the job?
A: First, we find the total work done in 13 days by 36 men. 1 job is done in 20 days, so in 1 day, 36 men do 1/20 of the job. In 13 days, they do 13 x (1/20) = 13/20 of the job. The remaining work to be done is 1 - 13/20 = 7/20. After 13 days, only 36 - 9 = 27 men are left to do the remaining work. Since 36 men do 1/20 of the job in a day, 27 men will do (27/36) x (1/20) of the job in a day. So, to finish the remaining 7/20 of the job, it will take (7/20) / ((27/36) x (1/20)) = (7/20) x (36/27) x 20 = 4/3 x 20 = 80/3 = 26.6667 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the next whole day. So, it will take 27 more days to complete the job. The answer is 27.

2852,True,"First, we need to find the total amount of sodium in the original recipe:

2 teaspoons of salt * 50 mg of sodium per teaspoon = 100 mg of sodium from salt
8 oz of parmesan cheese * 25 mg of sodium per oz = 200 mg of sodium from parmesan cheese

The total sodium in the original recipe = 100 + 200 = 300 mg.

James wants to reduce the total amount of sodium by 1/3rd, so:

300 mg * (1/3) = 100 mg of sodium reduction.

Now, we need to find out how much sodium will be in each ounce of parmesan cheese after the reduction:

Let x be the new sodium content per oz in the reduced recipe. Since we know the total sodium reduction for the cheese is 100 mg, we have:

8 oz * (x - 25 mg per oz) = 100 mg

Expanding and solving for x:

8x - 200 = 100

Now, solve for x:

8x = 300
x = 300/8
x = 37.5 mg of sodium per oz.

So, in the reduced recipe, 1 oz of parmesan cheese will have 37.5 mg of sodium. To find out how many ounces of parmesan cheese James needs to use to get the total reduction, we can set up an equation using the new sodium content per oz:

Total sodium to be reduced = 100 mg
Sodium content per oz = 37.5 mg

Number of ounces needed = Total sodium to be reduced / Sodium content per oz
Number of ounces needed = 100 / 37.5
Number of ounces needed = 2.67 oz

Since he originally used 8 oz, James needs to use 8 - 2.67 = 5.33 oz less of parmesan cheese.","First find how much sodium the parmesan has in total by multiply the amount of sodium per ounce by the number of oz: 25 mg/oz * 8 oz = <<25*8=200>>200 mg

Then find the total sodium in the recipe by adding the sodium from the cheese and the salt: 100 mg + 200 mg = <<100+200=300>>300 mg
Then multiply the total amount of sodium by 1/3 to find how much less sodium James wants: 300 mg * 1/3 = <<300*1/3=100>>100 mg

According to the problem, Martin rings the small bell 4 times more than 1/3 as often as the big bell, so the number of times he rings the small bell can be represented as (1/3)B + 4.

The combined total number of times Martin rings both bells is 52, so we can write the equation:

Q: A jar contains $44.80 in nickels and quarters. There are 230 coins in total. How many nickels are there?
A: Let x be the number of nickels and y be the number of quarters. We know that:

1. x + y = 230 (total number of coins)
2. 0.05x + 0.25y = 44.80 (total value of the coins)

From equation 1, we can express y in terms of x: y = 230 - x

Now substitute y in equation 2:

0.05x + 0.25(230 - x) = 44.80
0.05x + 57.50 - 0.25x = 44.80
-0.20x = -12.70
x = 63.5 (number of nickels)

The answer is 63.5. However, the number of coins must be a whole number, so we round up to the nearest whole number.

This means there are 15*2 = 30 burgers for the first group and 15*1 = 15 burgers for the second group, totaling 30+15 = 45 burgers. Carly can cook 5 burgers at once, so it will take her 45 / 5 = 9 rounds of cooking. Each round requires cooking both sides, so it takes 4 minutes x 2 = 8 minutes per round. Thus, it will take Carly 9 rounds x 8 minutes = 72 minutes to cook all the burgers. The answer is 72 minutes.","First find half the number of guests at Carly's party: 30 guests / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 guests

Then add the 15 burgers for the 15 guests who only want 1 to find the total number of burgers: 30 burgers + 15 burgers = 45 burgers
Then divide the total number of burgers by the number of burgers Carly can cook at once to find the number of batches she cooks: 45 burgers / 5 burgers/batch = <<45/5=9>>9 batches
Then multiply the number of sides per burger by the cooking time per side to find each burger's total cook time: 4 minutes/side * 2 sides = <<4*2=8>>8 minutes

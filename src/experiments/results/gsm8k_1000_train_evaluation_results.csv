1. Betty has half of the money she needs for the wallet:

Half of $100 is $100/2 = $50.

2. Her parents give her $15.

3. Her grandparents give her twice as much as her parents, which is 2 * $15 = $30.

4. Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Betty has after receiving money from her parents and grandparents:

Betty's initial savings ($50) + parents' contribution ($15) + grandparents' contribution ($30) = $50 + $15 + $30 = $95.

5. Finally, let's determine how much more money Betty needs to buy the wallet:

The total cost of the wallet is $100, and Betty has $95. To find the difference, subtract Betty's savings from the wallet's cost: $100 - $95 = $5.

Suit coat: $38
Socks: $11
Belt: $18

Total spent on these items: $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = $143

Alexis has $16 left from her $200 budget. So, she spent $200 - $16 = $184 in total.

Now, we can find the amount spent on the shoes by subtracting the total spent on items with receipts from the overall total spent:
$184 (total spent) - $143 (spent on items with receipts) = $41

29,False,"Let's denote Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income as X. She used to spend 40% of her income on rent and utilities, which is 0.40X. After her salary increase by $600, her new income is X + $600. Her new expenses for rent and utilities are now 25% of her monthly income, or 0.25(X + $600). Since her expenses did not change, we can equate the two:

0.40X = 0.25(X + $600)

Expanding the right side:

0.40X = 0.25X + 150

Subtract 0.25X from both sides:

0.40X - 0.25X = 150

Combine like terms:

0.15X = 150

Now we can solve for X by dividing both sides by 0.15:

X = 150 / 0.15

Equating both expressions for cost of rent and utilities: 2p/5 = (p+$600)/4

32,True,"Let's denote the distances traveled after the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd turns as D1, D2, and D3, respectively. We are given D1 = 5 meters and D2 = 8 meters. We also know the total distance around the ring (D1 + D2 + D3 + D4) is 23 meters.

From the problem, we can set up the following equation:

D1 + D2 + D3 + D4 = 23 meters

We can plug in the known values of D1 and D2:

5 + 8 + D3 + D4 = 23 meters

Now, we need to find the values of D3 and D4. We can simplify the equation:

13 + D3 + D4 = 23 meters

So,

D3 + D4 = 23 - 13

D3 + D4 = 10 meters

Since D4 is the distance traveled after the 4th turn, it represents the final segment of the ring. Therefore, D3 is the distance traveled after the 3rd turn. We need to find D3.

Since we know the total distance after three turns (D3 + D4) and the distance traveled after two turns (D2 = 8 meters), we can find D3 by subtracting D4 from the sum (D3 + D4):

D3 = (D3 + D4) - D4

However, we still don't have enough information to directly calculate D3. We need to consider the distance traveled after the 3rd turn and after the 4th turn as part of the 10 meters we previously found:

D3 + D4 = 10 meters

But without knowing either D3 or D4 alone, we cannot determine the exact distance traveled after the 3rd turn. We need additional information to solve this problem.

- For water: 10 cups * 240 mL/cup = 2400 mL

Question: Tim is training for a marathon and runs 5 kilometers each morning. After 2 weeks, he has run a total of 56 kilometers. How many days has Tim been running?

Answer: First, we need to determine the number of days in 2 weeks, which is 7 days/week * 2 weeks = 14 days. Knowing that Tim runs 5 kilometers each morning, and he has run a total of 56 kilometers, we can calculate the total number of days he has been running by dividing the total distance by the distance he runs each day, which gives us 56 km / 5 km/day = 11.2 days. However, since Tim can't run a fraction of a day, we'll round down to the nearest whole day, so he has been running for 11 days.

Since the store still makes a 20% profit on the shirt even after the discount, we know the $20 represents 80% of the cost price (because 100% - 20% profit margin = 80%).

The answer to the question ""In the following passage, there is an ambiguity. Explain how ambiguity can be problematic and how it can lead to misunderstandings or confusion.""

Ambiguity occurs when a single word, phrase, or sentence has more than one meaning or can be interpreted in multiple ways. This can lead to problems or misunderstandings because the lack of clarity can cause people to draw different conclusions or understandings of the same text. Ambiguity can be problematic in several ways:

1. In legal documents: Clear language is critical in legal documents to avoid ambiguity and ensure precise interpretation. Ambiguities can lead to lengthy litigation or misinterpretation of terms, causing potential disputes over the document's intended meaning.

2. In communication: In everyday conversation, ambiguity can result in confusion or misunderstandings between people. Ambiguous messages may require additional clarification, and the intended meaning can be lost or misunderstood, leading to ineffective communication.

3. In instructions or manuals: Ambiguity in instructions or manuals can lead to user error, potentially causing harm or damaging property. Clear, unambiguous instructions are vital for safety and ensuring that users can effectively operate equipment, use products, or follow procedures.

To prevent or minimize ambiguity, it's essential to use clear, precise language and define any terms or phrases that might be subject to multiple interpretations. Contextual clues, examples, or explanations can help ensure that the intended meaning is conveyed accurately.","10 cans are holding 8 liters each for a total of 10 * 8 = <<10*8=80>>80 liters

We can calculate the total cost for 960 sheets by first determining how many batches are needed: 960 sheets / 8 sheets/batch = 120 batches. Since each batch costs $0.25, the total cost for all batches is 120 batches * $0.25/batch = $30.

Question: A recipe calls for 3 eggs to serve 4 people. How many eggs are needed to serve 10 people?

Answer: The ratio of eggs to people is 3 eggs per 4 people. To find out how many eggs are needed for 10 people, we can set up a proportion. Let x be the number of eggs needed for 10 people: 3 eggs / 4 people = x eggs / 10 people. We solve this by cross-multiplication: 3 eggs * 10 people = 4 people * x eggs, which gives us 30 eggs = 4x eggs. Dividing both sides by 4 gives us x = 30 eggs / 4 = 7.5 eggs. Since we can't have half an egg in a recipe, we round up to the nearest whole number, which means 8 eggs are needed to serve 10 people.

Her remaining balance after 4 months is $780 - $260 = $520.
#### 520","Tara has to make a $1000 x 20/100 = $<<1000*20/100=200>>200 down payment.
Since Tara wants to pay $20 more for the down payment, her total down payment will be $200 + $20 = $<<200+20=220>>220.
So her remaining balance payable over a year is $1000 - $220 = $<<1000-220=780>>780.
Tara has to make a monthly payment of $780/year / 12 months/year = $<<780/12=65>>65/month.

Question: A cyclist travels a distance of 120 km in 4 hours. The next day, the cyclist increases their speed by 5 km/h. How far will they travel in 4 hours on the next day?

Answer: The original speed of the cyclist is the total distance divided by the time, which is 120 km / 4 hours = 30 km/h. By increasing the speed by 5 km/h, the new speed is 30 km/h + 5 km/h = 35 km/h.

Question: Emily collected 4 baskets of apples. Each basket contains 20 apples. She gave 2 baskets to her neighbors. How many apples does Emily have left?

Answer: Emily originally had 4 baskets with 20 apples each, which totals 4 * 20 = 80 apples. She gave 2 baskets to her neighbors, so she gave away 2 * 20 = 40 apples. The number of apples she has left is the original total minus the amount given away, which is 80 - 40 = 40 apples.

Question: A school has 985 students. If 75% of them are girls, how many boys are in the school?

Answer: If 75% of the students are girls, then 25% must be boys. We calculate the number of boys by finding 25% of the total number of students. 25% is the same as 0.25, so we multiply 0.25 by the total number of students: 0.25 * 985 = 246.25. Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 246 boys in the school.

Question: A water tank can hold 800 liters of water. During a drought, it loses 10% of its water every day. How much water will be left in the tank after 2 days?

Answer: Each day, the tank loses 10% of its water. On the first day, it loses 10% of 800 liters, which is 0.10 * 800 = 80 liters. The amount of water left after the first day is 800 - 80 = 720 liters. On the second day, it loses another 10% of the remaining water, which is 0.10 * 720 = 72 liters. The total amount of water left after the second day is 720 - 72 = 648 liters.

Question: There are 600 students in a school and 250 of them play basketball, 350 of them play soccer, and 100 students play both sports. How many students do not play either sport?

Answer: First, we must find the total number of students playing at least one sport. We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for this. If we sum the students who play basketball and soccer, we get 250 + 350 = 600. However, this total counts the 100 students who play both sports twice, so we need to subtract them once to get the accurate number.
Total number playing at least one sport = 600 - 100 = 500 students.
Now, we subtract this number from the total number of students to find those who do not play either sport: 600 - 500 = 100 students.

Question: An airplane has enough fuel to fly for 3 hours at a constant speed. If it flew for 1.5 hours at a speed of 400 mph, at what speed must it fly to reach its destination in the remaining time?

Answer: The airplane has enough fuel for 3 hours and has already flown for 1.5 hours, so it has 3 - 1.5 = 1.5 hours left.
The distance covered in the first 1.5 hours at a speed of 400 mph is 1.5 * 400 = 600 miles.
To cover this distance in the remaining time, we use the formula: distance = speed * time.
Speed = distance / time = 600 miles / 1.5 hours = 400 mph.
The airplane must fly at the same speed of 400 mph to reach its destination in the remaining time.

Next, we calculate how many fish Gail can have in each tank based on their sizes and the water volume.

In the second tank, she can have 24 gallons / 1 gallon per inch = 24 inches of fish. Since each fish is two inches long, she can keep 24 inches / 2 inches per fish = 12 fish in the second tank.

In the first tank, she has 48 gallons / 1 gallon per inch = 48 inches of fish. Since each fish is three inches long, she can keep 48 inches / 3 inches per fish = 16 fish in the first tank.

Now, if one fish in the first tank eats another fish, the total number of fish in the first tank becomes 16 - 1 = 15 fish.

Finally, we find the difference between the number of fish in the first tank and the second tank: 15 fish (first tank) - 12 fish (second tank) = 3 fish.

Question: There are four times as many red marbles as blue marbles in a bag. If there are 45 marbles in total, how many of each color are there?

Answer: Let the number of blue marbles be x. Then, the number of red marbles would be 4x because there are four times as many red marbles as blue ones. The total number of marbles is x (blue) + 4x (red) = 45. Simplifying, we get 5x = 45. Solving for x gives us x = 45 / 5 = 9 blue marbles. Since there are four times as many red marbles, we multiply 9 by 4 to find the number of red marbles: 9 * 4 = 36 red marbles.

However, if there are 36 red marbles as calculated, this would mean a total of 9 (blue) + 36 (red) = 45 marbles. This matches the total given, so indeed there are 9 blue marbles and 36 red marbles.

Answer: The first leg of the journey from City A to City B takes 2 hours, including a 15-minute stopover. The second leg from City B to City C takes 3 hours. To find the total time spent, we add the travel times and the stopover time. However, we only count the 15-minute stopover once, as it happens only during the first leg of the journey. So, total time spent is 2 hours (travel to City B) + 15 minutes (stopover) + 3 hours (travel to City C) = 2 hours + 0.25 hours + 3 hours = 5.25 hours.

Question: In a classroom, the number of students who like soccer is triple the number of students who like basketball. If there are 24 students in total and 4 students like both, how many students like only one sport?

Answer: Let the number of students who like basketball be b, so those who like soccer would be 3b. However, we must consider that there are 4 students who like both sports. The equation to represent this scenario would be: b + 3b - 4 = 24 (since the students who like both are being subtracted only once). Simplifying, we get 4b - 4 = 24. Adding 4 to both sides, 4b = 28. Dividing both sides by 4, b = 7. Now we know that 7 students like basketball, and thus 3 * 7 = 21 students like soccer. Those who like only soccer or only basketball, but not both, total b + (3b - 4) = 7 (basketball only) + (21 - 4) (soccer only) = 7 + 17 = 24 - 4 (both) = 20.

Difference in price per can = $0.50 (grocery store) - $0.25 (warehouse) = $0.25 per can

Since the question asks for the price difference in cents, we convert $0.25 to cents:

Question: Kevin read 2/3 of a book on Monday. If the book has 150 pages, how many pages has Kevin read?

Answer: Kevin read 2/3 of the 150-page book. To find out how many pages he has read, we multiply the total number of pages by 2/3: (2/3) * 150. We can simplify this to 2 * (150 / 3) = 2 * 50 = 100 pages.

Answer: 3/10 of the spaces are taken by sedans, so 3/10 * 120 = 36 spaces are occupied by sedans. The remaining spaces are 120 - 36 = 84 spaces. Of these, 2/5 are filled by other cars, so 2/5 * 84 = 168/5 = 33.6, which we'll round to 34 spaces (assuming we can't have a fraction of a space). So, there are 34 non-sedan cars parked in the lot.

Question: A fruit stand sells apples for $2 per pound and pears for $3 per pound. If a customer buys 5 pounds of apples and 4 pounds of pears, what is the total cost?

Answer: The customer buys 5 pounds of apples at $2 per pound, so the cost for apples is 5 * 2 = $10. They buy 4 pounds of pears at $3 per pound, so the cost for pears is 4 * 3 = $12. The total cost is the sum of the costs for apples and pears, which is 10 + 12 = $22.

142,True,"Let's start by understanding the situation. The first spray kills 50% of germs, so if we have 100 germs, it would kill 50. The second spray kills 25% of germs, but we can't apply it directly to the original 100 germs since it's 25% of the remaining germs after the first spray.

The key point here is that when using both sprays, there is an overlap where 5% of the germs they kill are the same. This means we have to account for this overlap when calculating the overall effectiveness.

Here's the calculation step by step:

1. After the first spray kills 50% of the germs, we have 50% left, or 50 germs remaining.

2. The second spray kills 25% of the remaining 50 germs, which is 0.25 * 50 = 12.5 germs. However, 5% of these killed germs are the same as those killed by the first spray, so we have to add back those 5% of the 50 germs. To find this, we calculate 0.05 * 50 = 2.5 germs.

3. Therefore, the net decrease in germs due to the second spray is 12.5 germs killed minus the 2.5 germs that were already accounted for in the first spray, which is 12.5 - 2.5 = 10 germs.

4. So, the total germs killed by both sprays together is the sum of the first spray's 50 germs killed plus the second spray's net 10 germs, totaling 60 germs.

5. To find the percentage of germs that remain after using both sprays, we subtract the total germs killed (60) from the original 100 germs and divide by the original number of germs. This gives us (100 - 60) / 100 = 0.4 or 40%.

6. Therefore, 40% of germs would be left after using both sanitizer sprays together.

Question: Jake has a rope that's 9 feet long. He wants to cut it into pieces that are each 1 and 1/4 feet long. How many pieces can he cut?

Answer: We need to divide the total length of the rope by the length of each piece. Since we are dealing with quarters of a foot, we'll first convert the rope length to quarters of a foot. There are 4 quarters in a foot, so 9 feet is 9 * 4 = 36 quarters. Each piece is 1 and 1/4 feet long, which is 5 quarters long.

Question: A farmer collected 350 eggs on Monday. He sold 40% of them to a bakery. How many eggs did the farmer sell to the bakery?

Answer: To find how many eggs the farmer sold to the bakery, we calculate 40% of 350. We know that 1% is 350 / 100 = 3.5 eggs. To find 40%, we multiply 3.5 eggs by 40: 3.5 eggs/percent * 40 percent = 14 eggs/percent * 40 percent = 14 * 40 = 560 eggs. However, since we cannot have more eggs than were collected, there must be a mistake in our calculations. Reassessing our calculation: 350 eggs * 40% = 350 * 0.40 = 140 eggs.

154,False,"First, we need to find out how much Ariella has in her son's savings account initially. Ariella has $200 more than Daniella, so Ariella has $400 + $200 = $600.

Ariella's account earns simple interest at a rate of 10% per annum. Simple interest is calculated using the formula I = PRT, where I is the interest, P is the principal (initial amount), R is the rate (as a decimal), and T is the time (in years).

In this case, P = $600, R = 10% = 0.10 (as a decimal), and T = 2 years. We can now calculate the interest earned in two years:

I = $600 * 0.10 * 2 = $120

After two years, Ariella will earn $120 in interest. To find out the total amount of money Ariella will have in her son's saving account after two years, we need to add the interest to the initial amount:

According to the problem, Maude will be 8 years old soon. Let's consider this future time to be in one time unit (e.g., one year from now), which will be represented as M + 1.


At that future point in time, Anne will be twice as old as Emile. We don't yet know Anne's age, so let's represent her age as A + X, where X is the number of years until Anne is twice as old as Emile. At the same time, Emile will be E + X years old. Therefore, when Anne is twice as old as Emile, we have the equation:


A + X = 2 * (E + X)


The problem also states that by the same time, Emile will be six times as old as Maude. So, we get another equation for the same X time:


E + X = 6 * (M + 1)


Since Maude is to be 8 years old, M = 8 - X (because we're looking back in time from when Maude is 8 by X years). Now, we can substitute M with (8 - X) in the second equation:


E + X = 6 * (8 - X + 1)


Solving the equation for E, we get:


E + X = 6 * (9 - X)

E + X = 54 - 6X

E = 54 - 7X


Substitute E back into the first equation:

A = 108 - 13X


Since we don't know the value of X yet, we can't determine Anne's current age (A) or Emile's current age (E), but we know their ages in terms of X. To find a numerical answer for Anne's age, we must know the value of the time units (X).

Question: Calculate the area of a rectangle that measures 14 cm by 9 cm. Additionally, subtract the area of a square with a side length of 3 cm. After that, determine what percentage of the remaining space would be covered if a circle with a radius of 2 cm was placed inside.

Answer: The area of the rectangle is length * width, which is 14 cm * 9 cm = 126 cm². The area of the square is side length² which is 3 cm * 3 cm = 9 cm². Subtracting the square's area from the rectangle's area, we have 126 cm² - 9 cm² = 117 cm². Now to find the area of the circle with radius 2 cm, we use the formula π * radius², which gives us π * (2 cm)² = π * 4 cm² ≈ 12.57 cm². To find what percentage of the remaining space is covered by the circle: (12.57 cm² / 117 cm²) * 100% ≈ 10.73%.

Question: Alex has a piggy bank with 150 coins consisting of quarters, dimes, and nickels. There are twice as many dimes as nickels, and the total value of the coins is $20. How many of each coin type does Alex have?

Answer: Let's represent the number of nickels with N, the number of dimes with D, and the number of quarters with Q. We have the following information:

1. D = 2N (twice as many dimes as nickels)
2. Total coins: N + D + Q = 150
3. Total value: 0.05N + 0.10D + 0.25Q = $20

Using the first equation, we can express D in terms of N: D = 2N. Now, we'll substitute this into the second and third equations.

2. N + 2N + Q = 150 => 3N + Q = 150
3. 0.05N + 0.10(2N) + 0.25Q = 20

Simplifying the third equation:

0.05N + 0.20N + 0.25Q = 20 => 0.25N + 0.25Q = 20

Now, let's divide the third equation by 0.25:

N + Q = 80

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

1. 3N + Q = 150
2. N + Q = 80

Subtract the second equation from the first:

(3N + Q) - (N + Q) = 150 - 80
2N = 70 => N = 35

Now we can find D:

D = 2N => D = 2 * 35 = 70

Finally, we can find Q:

N + D + Q = 150 => 35 + 70 + Q = 150 => Q = 45

So, Alex has 35 nickels, 70 dimes, and 45 quarters.
#### 35 nickels, 70 dimes, and 45 quarters","Kate bought 7 packs × 18 balls/pack = <<7*18=126>>126 red bouncy balls.

261,False,"First, let's determine how many of each fruit you bought. Since the fruits were split evenly, you bought 36 / 3 = 12 of each type.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the oranges. You bought 12 oranges at $0.50 each, so the cost is 12 * $0.50 = $6.

Since the total bill was $66, the cost of apples and watermelons together is $66 - $6 = $60.

Let A be the cost of one apple, and W be the cost of one watermelon. We know that the cost of one apple is the same as the cost of 1/4 of a watermelon, so we can write the following equation:
A = W/4.

Since you bought 12 apples and 12 watermelons for a total of $60, we can write the second equation as follows:
12A + 12W = $60.

Now, substitute A = W/4 into the equation:
12(W/4) + 12W = $60
(12W + 48W) / 4 = $60
60W = $240
W = $4

Now that we know the cost of one watermelon (W) is $4, we can find the cost of one apple (A) using the equation A = W/4:
A = $4 / 4
A = $1

If my total bill was $66 and I spent $6 on oranges then I spent $66 - $6 = $<<66-6=60>>60 on the other 2 fruit types.
Assuming the price of watermelon is W, and knowing that you can buy 4 apples for the same price and that the price of one apple is A, then 1W=4A
If we know we bought 12 watermelons and 12 apples for $60, then we know that $60 = 12W + 12A
Knowing that 1W=4A, then we can convert the above to $60 = 12(4A) + 12A
$60 = 48A + 12A
$60 = <<60=60>>60A
Then we know the price of one apple (A) is $60/60= $<<60/60=1>>1

Question: On Monday, a library had 140 people check out books. On Tuesday, 80 more people than on Monday checked out books. On Wednesday, the number of people who checked out books was half the number from Monday. What was the total number of people who checked out books over these three days?

Answer: On Tuesday, 80 more people than on Monday checked out books, so that's 140 + 80 = 220 people on Tuesday. On Wednesday, half the number of Monday's total checked out books, which is 140 / 2 = 70 people. To find the total number of people over three days, we add up each day: 140 (Monday) + 220 (Tuesday) + 70 (Wednesday) = 430 people.

328,True,"First, let's find out the number of motorcycles. A third of the vehicles are motorcycles, so 1/3 * 24 = 8 motorcycles.
Since there are 24 vehicles in total, the remaining vehicles are cars, which is 24 - 8 = 16 cars.

Next, we need to find out how many cars have a spare tire included. A quarter of the cars have a spare tire, so 1/4 * 16 = 4 cars have a spare tire.

Now, let's calculate the tires:

- Motorcycles typically have 2 tires each, so 8 motorcycles * 2 tires = 16 motorcycle tires.
- Cars typically have 4 tires each, so 12 cars (since 4 cars have a spare tire, and we subtract 4 from the total of cars) * 4 tires = 48 car tires.

Adding the car tires with spare tires gives us 48 + (4 cars * 1 extra tire) = 48 + 4 = 52 car tires.

Finally, we add the motorcycle tires and the car tires together: 16 motorcycle tires + 52 car tires = 68 tires in total on the used car lot's vehicles.

331,True,"First, let's calculate how many miles of road were paved on the second day. The company paved 4 miles on the first day, and one mile less than double that on the second day. So, double the first day's progress is 4 miles * 2 = 8 miles, and one mile less than that is 8 - 1 = 7 miles on the second day.

Now, let's calculate the total miles paved after two days. After the first day, there were 16 - 4 = 12 miles left. After the second day, there were 12 - 7 = 5 miles left to pave.

The company paves 3 truckloads of asphalt per mile, so they need 5 miles * 3 truckloads/mile = 15 truckloads of asphalt to finish the remaining road.

Now, let's find out the ratio of bags of gravel to barrels of pitch for each truckload of asphalt. We know that each truckload uses five times as many bags of gravel as barrels of pitch. If we let x represent the number of barrels of pitch, then 5x would represent the number of bags of gravel.

Since each truckload of asphalt uses one barrel of pitch and five bags of gravel (x + 5x = 6x), the 15 truckloads of asphalt will require 15 * 6x = 90x in total asphalt material.

Question: An artisan sells hand-painted mugs for $25 each. If the cost to produce a mug is $10, and the artisan's monthly expenses are $2000, how many mugs must be sold to break even?

Answer: The profit per mug is the selling price minus the cost to produce, which is $25 - $10 = $15 per mug. To find out how many mugs need to be sold to cover monthly expenses, we divide the total expenses by the profit per mug: $2000 / $15 ≈ 133.33. Since the artisan cannot sell a fraction of a mug, they must sell 134 mugs to break even.

Question: A farmer sells eggs in cartons of 12. This Monday, the farmer has 60 eggs. On Tuesday, the farmer collects enough eggs to fill another full carton. On Wednesday, the farmer sells 3 cartons to a local store. How many eggs are left at the end of Wednesday?

Answer: The farmer starts with 60 eggs on Monday. Each carton holds 12 eggs, so 60 / 12 = 5 cartons. On Tuesday, another 12 eggs are collected, which fills 1 carton. This means before any sales on Wednesday, the farmer has 5 + 1 = 6 cartons. On Wednesday, 3 cartons are sold. The eggs in 3 cartons are 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Question: Solve for the remainder when: 4x ≡ 5 (mod 9) 

Answer: To solve for the remainder, we must find the smallest positive integer value of x that satisfies the given congruence.

4x ≡ 5 (mod 9) can be rewritten as 4x = 5 + 9k, where k is some integer. To find the smallest x, we can test x = 1, 2, 3, etc.

For x = 1, 4x = 4 ≠ 5 + 9k (for any integer k).
For x = 2, 4x = 8 ≠ 5 + 9k (for any integer k).
For x = 3, 4x = 12 ≠ 5 + 9k (for any integer k).
For x = 4, 4x = 16 = 9 + 7, and 7 is a remainder when we divide by 9.

Since x = 4 is the first integer value to satisfy the congruence, x = 4 is the solution and the remainder is 7.

Question: Evaluate the integral: ∫(3x^2 - 5x + 2)dx from x = 1 to x = 4 

Answer: To solve the definite integral, we first find the indefinite integral with respect to x.

∫(3x^2 - 5x + 2)dx = [x^3 - (5/2)x^2 + 2x] + C, where C is the constant of integration. We now evaluate this expression from x = 1 to x = 4:

[4^3 - (5/2)*4^2 + 2*4] - [1^3 - (5/2)*1^2 + 2*1]
= [64 - 40 + 8] - [1 - 5/2 + 2]

a_2 = a_1 + 2*2 = 1 + 4 = 5
a_3 = a_2 + 2*3 = 5 + 6 = 11
a_4 = a_3 + 2*4 = 11 + 8 = 19

Question: John has read 3/7 of a book. If he reads another 12 pages, he has read 4/5 of the book. How many pages are in the book?

Answer: Let's denote the total number of pages in the book as P. John has read 3/7 of the book, so he has read (3/7)P pages.

After reading another 12 pages, he has read (4/5) of the book, so we have: (3/7)P + 12 = (4/5)P.

To solve for P, we'll eliminate fractions by multiplying each term by the least common multiple of the denominators (7 and 5), which is 35:

35 * (3/7)P + 35 * 12 = 35 * (4/5)P
5 * 3P + 35 * 12 = 7 * 4P
15P + 420 = 28P

Subtracting 15P from both sides, we get 420 = 28P - 15P
420 = 13P

Dividing both sides by 13, we find P = 420 / 13 ≈ 32.31

The book has approximately 32 pages.

Question: Solve the equation: \(3x - 7 = 2(x + 4)\).

Answer:
First, distribute the 2 on the right side of the equation to get rid of the parentheses:
\(3x - 7 = 2x + 8\)
Subtract \(2x\) from both sides to get all the \(x\)'s on one side:
\(3x - 2x - 7 = 2x - 2x + 8\)
This simplifies to:
\(x - 7 = 8\)
Now, add 7 to both sides to solve for \(x\):
\(x - 7 + 7 = 8 + 7\)
The solution is:
\(x = 15\)
To check our work, substitute 15 for \(x\) in the original equation:
\(3(15) - 7\) should equal \(2(15 + 4)\)
\(45 - 7 = 2 * 19\)
\(38 = 38\)
Since both sides are equal, our solution is correct.

Question: The sum of two numbers is 50. One number is 6 more than twice the other. What are the numbers?

Answer:
Let's denote the first number as \(x\) and the second number as \(y\). According to the problem, \(y = 2x + 6\) and \(x + y = 50\).
Now, substitute the value of \(y\) from the first equation into the second equation:
\(x + 2x + 6 = 50\)
Combine like terms:
\(3x + 6 = 50\)
Subtract 6 from both sides:
\(3x = 44\)
Now, divide by 3 to solve for \(x\):
\(x = \frac{44}{3}\)
\(x = 14 \frac{2}{3}\) or approximately 14.67
Now, use the value of \(x\) to solve for \(y\):
\(y = 2x + 6\)
\(y = 2(14 \frac{2}{3}) + 6\)
\(y = 29 \frac{1}{3} + 6\)
\(y = 35 \frac{1}{3}\)
So the two numbers are approximately 14.67 and 35.33.

Question: A car’s value depreciates to half its value every 4 years. If the car is worth $20,000 now, what will its value be in 12 years?

Answer: The car's value depreciates to half its value every 4 years. Over 12 years, this devaluation process will happen 12 / 4 = 3 times. If we start with a value of $20,000, the car's value after each depreciation period can be found by dividing the current value by 2. This sequence of values can be calculated as: 

- After the first 4 years: $20,000 / 2 = $10,000

- After the next 4 years (8 years total): $10,000 / 2 = $5,000

- After the last 4 years (12 years total): $5,000 / 2 = $2,500

This year's harvest per acre would then be 112 bales/acre * 12 acres = 1344 bales.

Question: The city's park has a circular pond with a radius of 7 meters. If the city wants to put a uniform border of flowers around the pond at a width of 1.5 meters, what will be the total area covered by the flowers?

Answer:

First, we find the area of the pond with the flowers. The new radius will be the pond's radius plus the border width, so 7 + 1.5 = 8.5 meters. The area with the flowers and the pond is the area of a circle with a radius of 8.5 meters.

Area with flowers and pond = π * (8.5)^2.

Calculating this: Area with flowers and pond = 3.14159 * (8.5)^2 ≈ 3.14159 * 72.25 ≈ 227.09 square meters.

The area of just the pond is π * 7^2.

Calculating this: Area of pond = 3.14159 * (7)^2 ≈ 3.14159 * 49 ≈ 153.94 square meters.

To get the area covered by the flowers alone, subtract the pond's area from the total area: 227.09 - 153.94 ≈ 73.15 square meters.

Question: Jenny has 60 minutes to complete her homework. She spends 20 minutes on math, and twice as much time on science as she does on math. She needs to spend the rest of the time writing an essay. How many minutes does she spend on her essay?

Answer: Jenny spends 20 minutes on math. She spends twice as much time on science, which means she spends 2 * 20 = 40 minutes on science.

She has spent a total of 20 (math) + 40 (science) = 60 minutes on math and science together.

Since she has 60 minutes in total for homework and she has already accounted for 60 minutes (20 + 40), she has 0 minutes remaining for the essay.

Question: Kevin reads at a pace of 30 pages per hour. He decides to read a book that is 450 pages long. How many hours and minutes will it take him to finish the book?

Answer: Kevin reads 30 pages in 1 hour. The book is 450 pages long, so we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages Kevin reads in an hour to find out how many hours he'll need.

450 pages / 30 pages/hour = 15 hours.

So Kevin will take 15 hours to finish the book. There are no additional minutes to be calculated since 15 hours is a whole number.

Next, we subtract this amount from the total money Timothy has to determine how much money he has left: $50 - $36 = $14.

Now, we need to determine how many pieces of key chains Timothy can buy with the $14 left. 3 key chains cost $2, so we first calculate the cost per piece of key chain: $2 / 3 = $0.67 per piece (approx.). To find out how many pieces he can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost per piece of key chain: $14 / $0.67 = 20.89 (approx.).

Since Timothy cannot buy a fraction of a key chain, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Timothy can buy 20 pieces of key chains with the remaining money he has.

Next, let's calculate the discount for the jackets:
The jacket has a 10% discount, so the discounted price for one jacket is $80 - (0.10 * $80) = $80 - $8 = $72. Therefore, the total cost of the jackets with the discount is 5 * $72 = $360.

Now, we'll add the total cost of all the items together:
Total cost = $48 (T-shirts) + $72 (sweaters) + $360 (discounted jackets) = $480

Normal earnings = $12/hour * 40 hours = $480.

Now, we need to determine the overtime earnings and hours. Let's denote the overtime pay rate as $12/hour * 1.5 = $18/hour. Let y represent the number of overtime hours. We can now set up the equation for Gary's total earnings:

Question: A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 cm, what are the rectangle's dimensions?

Answer: Let's denote the width as w and the length as 3w (since the length is 3 times the width). The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding together twice the length and twice the width, so we have the formula: Perimeter = 2(length) + 2(width) = 2(3w) + 2(w) = 6w + 2w = 8w. We know the perimeter is 48 cm, so 8w = 48 cm. Dividing both sides by 8 gives us w = 48 / 8 = 6 cm. The width is 6 cm and the length is 3 times the width, which is 3 * 6 cm = 18 cm.

Answer: There are 12 Judges over 50 years old (from the previous solution).

Question: There are 40 Judges in the state of Rhode Island.  10 percent of Judges are under 30 years old.  60 percent of Judges are 30-50 years old.  The rest of the Judges are over 50 years old. If we select 2 Judges randomly, what is the probability that both are over 50 years old?

Answer: From the previous solutions, we know there are 12 Judges over 50 years old.

The total number of ways to select 2 Judges out of 40 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n = 40 and k = 2.

The total number of ways to select 2 Judges is C(40, 2) = 40! / (2! * (40 - 2)!) = 780.

The number of ways to select 2 Judges who are over 50 years old is C(12, 2) = 12! / (2! * (12 - 2)!) = 66.

The probability that both selected Judges are over 50 years old is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes, which is 66/780.

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 6. 

66 ÷ 6 = 11, and 780 ÷ 6 = 130.

So, the probability that both selected Judges are over 50 years old is 11/130.

According to the problem, we have the following information:
M = $3
M = 3S (the magnet costs three times more than the sticker)
M = (1/4)A (the magnet costs one quarter the price of the two stuffed animals combined)

Since M = 3S, we can rewrite the second equation as 3S = (1/4)A.

Question: A recipe requires 2 cups of sugar to make 24 cookies. How many cups of sugar are needed to make 60 cookies?

Answer: The recipe provides a ratio of sugar to cookies as 2 cups of sugar / 24 cookies. We can set up a proportion to find out how many cups of sugar are needed for 60 cookies. Let y be the cups of sugar needed:

2 cups / 24 cookies = y cups / 60 cookies

Cross-multiply to get:

2 * 60 = 24 * y
120 = 24y

Divide both sides by 24:

y = 120 / 24
y = 5

So, 5 cups of sugar are needed to make 60 cookies.

Question: A rectangular garden has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the garden is 60 meters, what are the dimensions of the garden?

Answer: Let's denote the width of the garden as W and the length as L. We know that L = 2W and the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by P = 2L + 2W. We are given that P = 60 meters.

Now, substituting L with 2W in the formula for the perimeter:

60 = 2(2W) + 2W
60 = 4W + 2W
60 = 6W
Now, we divide both sides by 6 to find the width (W):
W = 60 / 6
W = 10 meters

Now we find the length (L) using L = 2W:
L = 2 * 10
L = 20 meters

So, the dimensions of the garden are:
Width (W) = 10 meters
Length (L) = 20 meters

For every 3 degrees below 32, the chance of skidding increases by 5%. So, we need to calculate how many 3-degree increments are in the 24-degree difference: 24 / 3 = 8 increments.

Now, let's calculate the total chance of skidding. Each increment adds 5% chance, so after 8 increments, the chance is 8 * 5% = 40%.

If Annie goes into a skid, there's a 40% chance of regaining control. Therefore, the chance of not regaining control (and having a serious accident) is 100% - 40% = 60%.

Thus, the percentage chance of Annie getting into a serious accident if she drives, given the temperature is 8 degrees, is 60%.
#### 60%","First find how many degrees below 32 the temperature is: 32 degrees - 8 degrees = <<32-8=24>>24 degrees

Multiply the number of increases by 5% to find the total increase in skid risk: 8 * 5% = 40%
Now find the chance that Annie has a serious accident if she goes into a skid by subtracting the chance she regains control from 100%: 100% - 40% = 60%

Question: A recipe calls for a ratio of 2 parts oil to 5 parts vinegar. If you use 10 ounces of oil, how many ounces of vinegar do you need?

Answer: The ratio of oil to vinegar is 2:5. If 10 ounces of oil correspond to 2 parts, then 1 part would correspond to 10 ounces / 2 = 5 ounces. Since vinegar requires 5 parts, we need 5 parts * 5 ounces/part = 25 ounces of vinegar.

529,False,"To find out how many rides you need to take for the 30-day pass to be cheaper per ride than the individual tickets, let's compare the cost per ride for each option. The cost per ride for a $2 ticket is $2 per ride. We want to find out when the cost per ride for the 30-day pass, which is $50 per month, becomes cheaper than $2 per ride. To find this breakeven point, we set up an equation where the cost per ride of the 30-day pass is less than $2:

\]

Solving for the number of rides:

\[

\]

\[

Question: The sum of two numbers is 55. The difference between twice the smaller number and the larger number is 15. What are the two numbers?

Answer: Let's represent the smaller number as x and the larger number as y. We have two equations based on the given information:

1) x + y = 55
2) 2x - y = 15

Now we can solve these equations simultaneously:

From equation (1), we can express y in terms of x:
y = 55 - x

Substitute this expression for y into equation (2):

2x - (55 - x) = 15
2x - 55 + x = 15
3x - 55 = 15
3x = 70
x = 70 / 3
x ≈ 23.33

Now, substitute x back into equation (1) to find y:

23.33 + y = 55

Her phone bill budget (P) is 10% of her food budget, so P = 0.1F.

The total budget for house rental and food is $240, so F + H = $240.

Now, we can substitute F in terms of H in the first equation:

Question: A school has 4 classrooms of different sizes. Classroom A can fit 35 students, Classroom B can fit 30% more students than Classroom A, Classroom C fits 20 fewer students than Classroom B, and Classroom D can fit as many students as Classrooms A and C combined. What is the total capacity of all the classrooms combined?

Answer:
- Classroom A can fit 35 students.
- Classroom B can fit 30% more students than Classroom A, which is 35 * 0.30 = 10.5 additional students. Rounded to a whole student, it's 11 students. Therefore, Classroom B fits 35 + 11 = 46 students.
- Classroom C fits 20 fewer students than Classroom B, which is 46 - 20 = 26 students.
- Classroom D can fit as many students as Classrooms A and C combined, so it can fit 35 (Classroom A) + 26 (Classroom C) = 61 students.
The total capacity of all the classrooms combined is 35 (Classroom A) + 46 (Classroom B) + 26 (Classroom C) + 61 (Classroom D) = 168 students.

Question: A train takes 4 hours to travel between two cities without stopping. Each city introduces a speed limit requiring the train to reduce its speed by 10 km/h, decreasing the speed by a total of 25%. With the new speed limit, how long will it take for the train to complete the trip now?

Answer:
- If the train's speed is reduced by 25%, the new speed is 75% of the original speed. If it takes 4 hours at the full speed, we need to find the original speed and then calculate the new speed.
- Let's assume the original speed is 'S' km/h. The distance covered is speed * time, so D = S * 4.
- With the new speed, it's S * 0.75 (since it's reduced by 25%, it is 75% of the original speed).
- The distance remains the same, so we have D = S * 4 = S * 0.75 * New Time.
- To find the new time (New Time), we rearrange the formula: New Time = D / (S * 0.75).
- We know that D = S * 4, so we substitute: New Time = (S * 4) / (S * 0.75) = 4 / 0.75 = 5.33 hours, which is 5 hours and 20 minutes.
- It will now take the train 5 hours and 20 minutes to travel between the two cities with the new speed limit.
#### 5 hours and 20 minutes","Bianca = <<12.5=12.5>>12.5 hours

The minimum recommendation is 2 cups per day. So, for 7 days, Sarah should eat 2 cups * 7 days = 14 cups of vegetables per week.

Sarah has eaten 8 cups by the end of Thursday. That leaves 14 - 8 = 6 cups for the remaining two days (Friday and Saturday).

To find out the average cups per day for the remaining two days, we divide the remaining cups by the number of days left: 6 cups / 2 days = 3 cups per day.

601,False,"First, we need to convert the speeds from miles per hour to feet per second.

Cheetah: 60 mph * 1.5 feet/sec = 90 feet/sec
Gazelle: 40 mph * 1.5 feet/sec = 60 feet/sec

Since both animals are moving in the same direction, we need to find the difference in their speeds to calculate how fast the cheetah is catching up to the gazelle.

Relative speed = Cheetah's speed - Gazelle's speed
Relative speed = 90 feet/sec - 60 feet/sec = 30 feet/sec

Now we need to find how many seconds it takes for the cheetah to cover the 210 feet gap between it and the gazelle.

Time = Distance / Relative speed

So, it would take the cheetah 7 seconds to catch up to the fleeing gazelle.

Question: In an office, there are 120 pens in 8 packs. If the office decides to open all packs and divide the pens equally among 16 employees, how many pens will each employee receive?

Answer: First, we find the total number of pens by multiplying the number of packs by the pens in each pack: 8 packs * 15 pens/pack = 120 pens. These pens are to be divided among 16 employees. Each employee will receive 120 / 16 = 7.5 pens. As it's impossible to have half a pen, we might need to consider that not all pens were divided equally, or some pens were given as individual units instead of being in packs.

Question: A theater sells adult tickets for $10 and child tickets for $5. If 120 tickets were sold, generating a total of $900, how many child tickets were sold?

Answer: Let A be the number of adult tickets and C be the number of child tickets. We have two equations: A + C = 120 (total tickets) and 10A + 5C = 900 (total revenue). We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, let's isolate A from the first equation: A = 120 - C.
Now, we plug this value into the second equation: 10(120 - C) + 5C = 900. Simplifying, we get 1200 - 10C + 5C = 900, which further simplifies to -5C = -300. Solving for C, we find C = 60.

Question: A farmer has 15 chickens and cows. The number of legs of these animals is 44. How many chickens does the farmer have?

Answer: Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as K. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. The total number of animals gives us the equation C + K = 15. The total number of legs gives us another equation, 2C + 4K = 44.

Now we solve these two equations simultaneously. From the first equation, we can express K as K = 15 - C. We can substitute this into the second equation: 2C + 4(15 - C) = 44. Simplify the equation: 2C + 60 - 4C = 44, which further simplifies to -2C = -16. Solving for C, we find C = 8.

Question: At a fruit stand, apples cost $2 per kilogram and oranges cost $3 per kilogram. If a customer buys 10 kilograms of fruit for $26, how many kilograms of apples did the customer buy?

Answer: Let A be the kilograms of apples and O be the kilograms of oranges. We have the equations A + O = 10 (total weight of fruits) and 2A + 3O = 26 (total cost).

We can solve these equations simultaneously. From the first equation, O = 10 - A. We substitute this into the second equation: 2A + 3(10 - A) = 26.
Expanding the equation gives us 2A + 30 - 3A = 26. Simplifying further, we get -A = -4. Solving for A, we find A = 4.

617,False,"First, we need to calculate the additional penalty for speeding. Mark was driving 75 - 30 = 45 miles per hour over the speed limit. The fine for speeding is increased by $2 for every mile per hour over the limit, so the additional penalty is 45 * 2 = $90.

The base fine is $50, so the total speeding fine before any further penalties is 50 + 90 = $140.

Since he was speeding in a school zone, the fine is doubled: 140 * 2 = $280.

Additionally, Mark needs to pay the court costs and his lawyer's fees: 300 + (80 * 3) = $540.

Question: A rectangular garden has a length that is 4 meters longer than its width. If the garden's area is 96 square meters, what are the garden's dimensions?

Answer: Let the width of the garden be w meters. Then the length is (w + 4) meters. The area of a rectangle is length times width:
Area = w * (w + 4) = 96 square meters.
Set up the quadratic equation:
w^2 + 4w - 96 = 0
Factor to find w:
(w + 12)(w - 8) = 0
The positive solution for width is w = 8 meters (since width must be positive).
Determine the length:
Length = w + 4 = 8 meters + 4 meters = 12 meters.
The dimensions of the garden are width = 8 meters and length = 12 meters.

Question: A recipe calls for 2 cups of sugar for every 5 cups of flour. If a baker wants to use 20 cups of flour, how many cups of sugar does she need?

Answer: The recipe calls for a 2:5 ratio of sugar to flour. For 20 cups of flour, we calculate the amount of sugar needed using a proportion: (2 cups sugar / 5 cups flour) = (x cups sugar / 20 cups flour). Cross-multiply to solve for x: 2 * 20 = 5 * x, which simplifies to 40 = 5x. Divide both sides by 5 to solve for x: x = 40 / 5 = 8 cups of sugar.

In a class of 30 students, 40% are boys. If 20% of the boys are absent one day, how many boys are present?

Answer: The number of boys in the class is 40% of 30. We calculate this as (40 / 100) * 30 = 12 boys in the class. If 20% of the boys are absent, that means 80% are present. So, we calculate the number of boys present as 80% of 12 boys, which is (80 / 100) * 12 = 9.6. Since we can't have a fraction of a boy, we round down to 9 boys present.

Question: A rectangle field has a length of 100 meters and a width of 50 meters. To install a fence around it, how many meters of fencing is required?

Answer: To calculate the total length of fencing required, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter P of a rectangle is given by P = 2 * (length + width). So, P = 2 * (100 + 50) = 2 * 150 = 300 meters. Hence, 300 meters of fencing are required.

Question: Alice and Bob are running on a track that is 400 meters long. If Alice runs at a pace of 8 minutes per kilometer and Bob runs at a pace of 7 minutes per kilometer, who will finish the track first?

Answer: To solve this problem, we must convert meters to kilometers and then calculate the time it takes for each runner to complete the track. 400 meters is 0.4 kilometers. For Alice: Time = 8 minutes/km * 0.4 km = 3.2 minutes. For Bob: Time = 7 minutes/km * 0.4 km = 2.8 minutes. Bob finishes first since it takes him less time (2.8 minutes) compared to Alice (3.2 minutes).

689,True,"First, we determine the cost of a Lyft ride. The Lyft ride costs $4 more than a taxi ride. Since the Uber ride costs $3 more than the Lyft ride, and the Uber ride costs $22, we can find the cost of the Lyft ride by subtracting the additional $3 from the Uber cost and then subtracting the additional $4 for the Lyft cost.

Uber ride cost = $22
Lyft ride cost = Uber ride cost - $3 (Uber difference) - $4 (Lyft difference)
Lyft ride cost = $22 - $3 - $4 = $15

Now, we know that the Lyft ride costs $15. Since the Lyft ride costs $4 more than a taxi ride, we can find the original cost of the taxi ride by subtracting the Lyft difference from the Lyft cost.

Taxi ride cost = Lyft ride cost - $4
Taxi ride cost = $15 - $4 = $11

Trevor also tips the taxi driver 20% of the original cost of the ride. To find the tip amount, we multiply the original cost of the ride by 20%.

Tip amount = Taxi ride cost * 20%
Tip amount = $11 * 0.20 = $2.20

Finally, we add the original cost of the ride and the tip amount to find the total cost of the ride downtown.

Question: Kevin is an avid stamp collector and wants to purchase exactly 60 stamps. The post office sells packets of 8 stamps or individual stamps. If Kevin bought an equal number of packets and individual stamps, how many stamps would he have purchased in total?

Answer: If Kevin bought an equal number of packets and individual stamps, let's call the number of each type of pack Kevin bought ""x."" Each packet contains 8 stamps and each individual stamp is 1 stamp.

The total number of stamps would be 8x (from packets) + x (from individual stamps) = 9x stamps.

We are told Kevin wants exactly 60 stamps, so:

9x = 60.

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 9:

x = 60 / 9 = 6.666...

Since Kevin cannot buy a fraction of a packet or a stamp, we must round down to the nearest whole number. Thus, Kevin can buy 6 packets and 6 individual stamps.

Total stamps Kevin would have after the purchase: 

6 packets * 8 stamps/packet + 6 individual stamps = 48 stamps + 6 stamps = 54 stamps.

However, Kevin wants exactly 60 stamps. Since we can't buy a fraction of a packet or stamp and he already has 54, Kevin needs to buy 2 more individual stamps.

So the final total number of stamps Kevin would have:

54 stamps + 2 individual stamps = 56 stamps.

Question: A rectangular garden measuring 15 meters by 10 meters is to be surrounded by a walkway of uniform width. If the area of the walkway is to be 54 m², what must the width of the walkway be?

Answer: Let's denote the width of the walkway as 'w' meters. The outer dimensions of the area including the walkway will be (15 + 2w) meters by (10 + 2w) meters. The area of the garden plus the walkway is the product of these two dimensions: (15 + 2w)(10 + 2w).

The area of just the garden is 15 meters * 10 meters = 150 m². The total area, including the walkway, is 150 m² + 54 m² = 204 m².

To find the width 'w', we set up the equation:
(15 + 2w)(10 + 2w) = 204
150 + 30w + 20w + 4w² = 204
4w² + 50w + 150 - 204 = 0
4w² + 50w - 54 = 0

Dividing the entire equation by 2 to simplify, we get:
2w² + 25w - 27 = 0

This quadratic equation must be solved to find 'w'. Let's solve it by factoring or using the quadratic formula. In this case, using the quadratic formula seems more appropriate:

w = [-25 ± sqrt(25² - 4 * 2 * (-27))]/(2 * 2)
w = [-25 ± sqrt(625 + 216)]/4
w = [-25 ± sqrt(841)]/4
w = [-25 ± 29]/4

Since width can't be negative, we take the positive solution:
w = (29 - 25)/4
w = 4/4
w = 1 meter

Therefore, the width of the walkway must be 1 meter.

Question: A bag contains 6 red, 4 blue, and 10 green marbles. If we pick one marble without looking, what is the probability it will be green?

Answer: The probability of picking a green marble is the number of green marbles divided by the total number of marbles. There are 10 green marbles and a total of 6 (red) + 4 (blue) + 10 (green) = 20 marbles. So, the probability of picking a green marble is 10 / 20 = 1/2 or 0.5.

In a class of 32 students, 40% of them are girls. How many boys are there?

Answer: To find out how many girls there are, multiply the total number of students by the percentage of girls: 32 * 0.40 = 12.8, which we can round up to 13 girls because we can't have a fraction of a student.
Now, to find out how many boys there are, subtract the number of girls from the total number of students: 32 - 13 = 19 boys.

A farmer has chickens and cows on his farm. The animals have a total of 50 heads and 140 legs. How many chickens and how many cows are there?

Answer: Let's use the letters C for chickens and W for cows. We know that chickens have 1 head and 2 legs, while cows have 1 head and 4 legs.

The two equations we can form from this information are:

C + W = 50 (equation for heads)
2C + 4W = 140 (equation for legs)

Now we can solve this system of equations. First, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to make it easier to solve:

2C + 2W = 100

Next, subtract this new equation from the second equation:

2C + 4W - (2C + 2W) = 140 - 100
2W = 40

Now we can solve for W:

W = 40 / 2
W = 20

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can plug this back into the first equation to find the number of chickens:

C + 20 = 50
C = 50 - 20
C = 30

So, there are 30 chickens and 20 cows on the farm.
#### Chickens: 30

A car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour. How far can it travel in 1 hour and 45 minutes?

Answer: To find out how far the car can travel, multiply its speed by the time it is traveling. Since 45 minutes is 0.75 hours (since 45 minutes / 60 minutes = 0.75 hours), the time it is traveling is:

1 hour + 0.75 hours = 1.75 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance the car can travel:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour × 1.75 hours
Distance = 105 miles

The perimeter of a rectangle is 100 cm, and its length is 30 cm. What is its width?

Answer: The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is given by:

Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width)

Now, we can plug the given values into the formula:

100 cm = 2 × (30 cm + Width)

Divide both sides by 2:

50 cm = 30 cm + Width

Subtract 30 cm from both sides to find the Width:

Width = 50 cm - 30 cm
Width = 20 cm

## Instruction 2 (Much more difficult, with at least {ct} more constraints)

**Instruction:**
The task is to determine which of the following sequences contains a prime number. Provide a step-by-step analytical evaluation, explaining how each candidate number was determined to be prime or not. Assume a base level understanding of prime numbers up to 100 and use at least three different prime-checking methods. Include a time complexity analysis for each method applied. For the sequence containing the prime number, calculate the sum of that prime number with its immediate predecessor and successor, if they exist in the sequence.

1. `24, 75, 103, 23, 44, 35`
2. `81, 53, 16, 29, 97, 10`
3. `47, 11, 76, 58, 92, 45`

Assume the availability of an optimized prime-checking function, `isPrime(int)`, to aid in calculations.

   - 103: Prime (only divisors are 1 and 103; it's within base 100 knowledge of primes)
   - 23: Prime (only divisors are 1 and 23; it's within base 100 knowledge of primes)
   - 44: Not prime (divisible by 2 and 11)
   - 35: Not prime (divisible by 5 and 7)
   - The prime numbers in this sequence are 103 and 23. The sum of the prime number and its immediate predecessor (23 + 103 = 126) and the sum of the prime number and its successor (23 + 44 = 67) are 126 and 67, respectively.
   - Prime-checking methods applied: trial division, checking for divisibility by primes up to 10 (optimized time complexity of O(sqrt(n)))

2. Sequence: `81, 53, 16, 29, 97, 10`
   - 81: Not prime (divisible by 3, 9)
   - 53: Prime (only divisors are 1 and 53; it's within base 100 knowledge of primes)
   - 16: Not prime (divisible by 2 and 4)
   - 29: Prime (only divisors are 1 and 29; it's within base 100 knowledge of primes)
   - 97: Prime (only divisors are 1 and 97; it's within base 100 knowledge of primes)
   - 10: Not prime (divisible by 2 and 5)
   - The prime numbers in this sequence are 53, 29, and 97. The prime number within the given base knowledge is not present in this sequence.

Next, we calculate the distance John covers by himself. His speed is 4 miles per hour, so in 0.5 hours, he will cover:
Distance alone = 4 mph * 0.5 hours = 2 miles

Finally, we add the distances John covered with his dog and alone to find the total distance:
Total distance = 3 miles + 2 miles = 5 miles

Question: A rectangle has a perimeter of 48 meters, and the length is twice as long as the width. What is the area of the rectangle?

Answer: Let's denote the width as w and the length as l. The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is calculated by P = 2l + 2w. 

Since the length is twice the width, we can say l = 2w. The perimeter is 48 meters, so we have the equation: 48 = 2(2w) + 2w, which simplifies to 48 = 4w + 2w.

Combining like terms gives us 48 = 6w, and then dividing by 6 gives us w = 48 / 6 = 8 meters.

Now that we have the width, we can find the length since l = 2w, thus l = 2 * 8 = 16 meters.

The area (A) of a rectangle is calculated by A = l * w.

Substitute the values of l and w into the formula: A = 16 meters * 8 meters = 128 square meters.

Divide by 4: 25 = w^2

Now, take the square root of both sides: w = ±5

However, since width can't be negative, we only consider w = 5 m.

So, the length is 4w = 4*5 = 20 m.
#### 20","Let L be the length and W be the width of the rectangle.
Hence L = 4* W

Solve for W and find L
4 W^2 = 100
W^2 = 25, W = 5 and

Question: There are 40 students in a class, and each student needs 3 pencils for an exam. The teacher has 200 pencils. Do they have enough pencils for the students, and if so, how many pencils will be left over?

Answer: 

We calculate the total number of pencils needed by multiplying the number of students by the number of pencils each student requires:
Pencils needed = students × pencils per student = 40 students × 3 pencils/student = 120 pencils

The teacher has 200 pencils, so we subtract the pencils needed from the total pencils available to find the remainder:

He sells another bike that cost 20% more than the bike he returned for. The cost of the returned bike was $500, and 20% of that cost is 0.20 * $500 = $100. So, the cost of the bike he sells is $500 + $100 = $600. He sells it for 80% of what he bought it for, which is 0.80 * $600 = $480.

Now, let's calculate the overall change in his finances:

Question: If a train travels at an average speed of 90 km/h and it takes 4 hours to travel from City A to City B, how long will it take for the train to make a round trip between the two cities?

Answer: The distance between City A and City B can be found by multiplying the train's speed by the travel time: 90 km/h * 4 hours = 360 km. Since the round trip is twice the distance, it's 360 km * 2 = 720 km. Given the constant speed of 90 km/h, the time to travel 720 km would be 720 km / 90 km/h = 8 hours.

Question: A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 meters, what are the rectangle's dimensions?

Answer: Let the width of the rectangle be W meters. Then the length is 2W meters. The perimeter P of a rectangle is given by P = 2*(length + width). We know that P = 36 meters, so we have:

36 = 2*(2W + W)
36 = 2*(3W)
36 = 6W

To find the width, we divide by 6:

W = 36 / 6 = 6 meters

Since the length is twice the width:

Length = 2 * W = 2 * 6 = 12 meters

So the dimensions of the rectangle are 6 meters by 12 meters.

Question: Emily has a box of crayons. The box has 24 crayons, and each crayon is either red, blue, or green. She has twice as many blue crayons as green crayons, and there are 6 red crayons. How many blue crayons are there?

Question: A gardener is planting flowers in a garden. He plants 28 roses, 17 tulips, and 15 daisies. If he wants the ratio of roses to tulips to daisies to be 2:1:1, how many more tulips and daisies does he need to plant?

Answer: The gardener has planted 28 roses, which we will use as our base for the 2:1:1 ratio. For the ratio to work, there should be half as many tulips and daisies as there are roses. The gardener has 17 tulips and 15 daisies. To find out how many more he needs to plant, we determine the difference from the ratio requirements. For the roses, since the ratio is already a perfect 2:1:1, there are no roses to add. However, for the tulips, we calculate 28 roses / 2 = 14 tulips needed. The gardener has 17 tulips, so he does not need to plant any more tulips. For the daisies, we also calculate 28 roses / 2 = 14 daisies needed. The gardener has 15 daisies, so he has already planted one more than needed and does not need to plant any more daisies either. Conclusion: The gardener does not need to plant any more flowers to achieve the desired 2:1:1 ratio since he already has 17 tulips (which is more than the required 14) and 15 daisies (which is more than the required 14).

Question: A train travels 150 miles in the same time it takes a car to travel 200 miles. If the car's speed is 20 mph faster than the train's speed, what is the train's speed?

Answer: 

Let x represent the train's speed in mph. Then, the car's speed is x + 20 mph. Since they travel for the same amount of time, we can set up the equation:

Time for train = Time for car

Distance/Speed = Distance/Speed (since time is constant)

For the train: 150 miles / x mph

For the car: 200 miles / (x + 20) mph

Now we set them equal to each other since the times are the same:

150/x = 200/(x + 20)

Cross-multiplying gives us:

150(x + 20) = 200x

150x + 3000 = 200x

3000 = 200x - 150x

Total candies = (number of red candies) + (number of yellow candies) + (number of blue candies)
Total candies = 40 + 20 + 10
Total candies = 70

Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, which were 20. To find out how many candies remained, we subtract the yellow candies from the total candies:
Remaining candies = Total candies - (number of yellow candies)

Remaining candies = 50

Question: There's a rectangular field with a length of 80 meters and a width of 60 meters. If a path 2 meters wide is built around the field inside, what is the length of the path in meters?

Answer: The length of the field is 80 meters, and the width is 60 meters. The path goes around the field, adding 2 meters on each side. So the total increase in length is 2 meters + 2 meters = 4 meters and in width is the same. The new dimensions are therefore 80 + 4 meters by 60 + 4 meters. The new dimensions are 84 meters by 64 meters. The path runs along the inside border, so we calculate the area of the path by subtracting the area of the field from the area of the new rectangle. The area of the field is 80 * 60 = 4800 square meters. The area of the new rectangle is 84 * 64 = 5376 square meters. The area of the path is 5376 square meters - 4800 square meters = 576 square meters. Since the path is 2 meters wide, we divide the area of the path by the width to find the length of the path. The length of the path is 576 square meters / 2 meters = 288 meters.

Question: There are 120 seats in a movie theater. On a particular day, the theater sold 75% of its tickets during the first showing, 50% of the remaining tickets during the second showing, and 30% of the remaining tickets after the second showing during the third showing. How many seats were left unsold?

Answer: During the first showing, 75% of the seats were sold. So, the number of seats sold in the first showing is (75/100) * 120 = 90 seats. This leaves 120 - 90 = 30 seats unsold after the first showing.

During the second showing, 50% of the remaining 30 seats were sold. So, the number of seats sold in the second showing is (50/100) * 30 = 15 seats. This leaves 30 - 15 = 15 seats unsold after the second showing.

During the third showing, 30% of the remaining 15 seats were sold. So, the number of seats sold in the third showing is (30/100) * 15 = 4.5.

Question: A group of friends shared the cost of a meal that was $120. If each person contributed $15 more than what was initially agreed upon, and there were 8 people, how much was the total agreed-upon amount for the meal?

Answer: Let the initially agreed-upon amount per person be x dollars. Since each person contributed $15 more, the amount each person paid was x + $15. There were 8 people, so the total amount paid by all of them is 8 * (x + $15). This equals the cost of the meal: $120, so we have the equation 8 * (x + $15) = $120.

Expanding and simplifying the equation: 8x + 8 * $15 = $120. Thus: 8x + $120 = $120. Subtracting $120 from both sides of the equation gives us: 8x = 0. Since 8 times a number cannot be $0 if the number is nonzero, we conclude that the initially agreed-upon amount per person x is $0, which does not seem logical in the context of the problem.

Subtracting 6t from both sides of the equation, we get 3t = 1. Solving for t, we divide both sides by 3, and we find that t = 1/3 hours.
To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60. So, 1/3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 20 minutes.
Therefore, it will take Jim 20 minutes to catch up to Bob.
#### 20","Bob runs .1 miles per minute because 6 / 60 = <<6/60=.1>>.1

Question: The length of a rectangular room is three times its width. If the area of the floor is 108 square meters, what are the dimensions of the room?

Answer: Let's denote the width of the room as w, so the length is three times the width, which is 3w. The area of the floor is given as 108 square meters. The area of a rectangle is calculated as length times width, so we have:

Area = length * width = 3w * w = 108

Now, we solve for w^2:

3w^2 = 108

w^2 = 108 / 3

w^2 = 36

Taking the square root of both sides:

w = 6

Since the length is three times the width:

length = 3w = 3 * 6 = 18

The dimensions of the room are width 6 meters and length 18 meters.

Now, we subtract the lost length due to knots from the total length of the ropes:

Question: The school store sold some pencils on Monday. They sold 64 on Tuesday, which was 50% more than the number sold on Monday. How many pencils did they sell on Monday?

Answer: Let's call the number of pencils sold on Monday X. If the store sold 50% more on Tuesday, this means they sold the Monday amount plus an additional 50% of the Monday amount. So, Tuesday's sales were 1.5 times Monday's sales. We know they sold 64 pencils on Tuesday, so:
64 = 1.5X
To find Monday's sales (X), we divide both sides by 1.5:
X = 64 / 1.5
X = 42.67
Since the number of pencils sold must be a whole number, we round down to 42.
Therefore, the store sold 42 pencils on Monday.

Question: A cyclist travels a certain distance uphill, then the same distance downhill. Her uphill speed is 8 km/h, and her downhill speed is 12 km/h. If the entire trip takes 3 hours, how far did she travel uphill and downhill?

Answer: Let x be the distance traveled in each direction. The time taken to travel uphill is x / 8, and the time taken to travel downhill is x / 12. The total time taken is 3 hours, so we can write the equation:

x / 8 + x / 12 = 3

To solve this equation, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 8 and 12 is 24. We rewrite the equation as:

3x / 24 + 2x / 24 = 3

Combining the fractions, we get:

5x / 24 = 3

Now, we multiply both sides of the equation by 24:

5x = 3 * 24

5x = 72

Finally, we divide both sides by 5:

x = 72 / 5

x = 14.4

So, the cyclist traveled 14.4 kilometers uphill and 14.4 kilometers downhill.

Question: A rectangular pool has a length that is 4 times its width. If the perimeter of the pool is 90 meters, what are the dimensions of the pool?

Answer: Let the width be x meters. Then the length is 4x meters. The perimeter P of a rectangle is given by P = 2 * length + 2 * width. We have P = 90 meters, so:
90 = 2 * (4x) + 2 * x
90 = 8x + 2x
90 = 10x
x = 90 / 10
x = 9 meters (width)
The length is 4 times the width, so length = 4 * 9 = 36 meters.
Dimensions of the pool are length = 36 meters and width = 9 meters.

Question: A farmer has 450 apples and sells them in bags containing 5 apples each. If 10% of the apples are too bruised to sell, how many apples are sold in bags?

Answer: First, we find out how many apples are bruised: 10% of 450 apples = 0.10 * 450 = 45 apples. These are not sellable, so they are subtracted from the total: 450 - 45 = 405 sellable apples. Next, we calculate how many 5-apple bags can be made: 405 apples / 5 apples/bag = 81 bags. Since each bag contains 5 apples, the number of apples sold in bags is 81 bags * 5 apples/bag = 405 apples.

First, let's find out how many donuts he needs to sell:
He sells each donut for $1, so to raise $96, he needs to sell 96 donuts.

Now, let's calculate how many dozen donuts he needs:
Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of donuts (96) by 12:

Answer: If 3/7 of the students are girls, then the remaining 4/7 must be boys (since 3/7 + 4/7 = 7/7, or the whole). We calculate the number of boys by finding 4/7 of the total student population. The total students are 1560, so the number of boys is (4/7) * 1560. First, we calculate 1/7 of 1560: 1560 / 7 = 222.86 (approximately). Then we multiply this by 4 to find 4/7: 222.86 * 4 = 891.44 (approximately). Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we round down to the nearest whole number, which gives us 891 boys.

## Instruction 2 (Much more difficult, with at least {ct} more constraints)

Question: An artist is creating a large mosaic using only square tiles that measure 10 cm on each side. The mosaic design requires the following:
- Half of the mosaic will be blue tiles, each taking up 0.5 square meters.
- A quarter of the mosaic will be green tiles, each taking up 0.25 square meters.
- The remaining area will be covered with white tiles, each measuring 0.4 square meters.

The total area of the mosaic needs to be exactly 8 square meters. Additionally, the artist prefers to use whole tiles only and avoids cutting tiles if possible. Determine the exact number of each color tile to be used, adhering to these constraints.

Answer:

1. Calculate the total area for each color based on the fractions given:
- Half of the mosaic is blue: 0.5 * 8 m² = 4 m²
- A quarter of the mosaic is green: 0.25 * 8 m² = 2 m²
- The remaining quarter is white (since 1 - 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25): 0.25 * 8 m² = 2 m²

2. Calculate the number of each tile, given their area and the requirement for whole tiles:
- Blue tiles: Each tile is 0.5 m². Therefore, the number of blue tiles needed is 4 m² / 0.5 m²/tile = 8 tiles (since 4 / 0.5 = 8).
- Green tiles: Each tile is 0.25 m². Therefore, the number of green tiles needed is 2 m² / 0.25 m²/tile = 8 tiles (since 2 / 0.25 = 8).
- White tiles: Each tile is 0.4 m². Since we are using whole tiles, we will round the area of 2 m² to the nearest multiple of 0.4 m², which is 2.4 m². This allows for a whole number of white tiles, which is 2.4 m² / 0.4 m²/tile = 6 tiles.

The final count of each color tile is:
- Blue tiles: 8
- Green tiles: 8
- White tiles: 6

The artist should use 8 blue tiles, 8 green tiles, and 6 white tiles to create the mosaic without cutting any tiles.
#### Blue: 8 tiles, Green: 8 tiles, White: 6 tiles

## Follow-up Question 1:

---

If the artist decides to increase the area of the mosaic to 10 square meters while maintaining the same color ratio, how many of each type of tile will the artist need now?

Answer:

1. Calculate the new area for each color based on the same ratio:
- Blue area: 0.5 * 10 m² = 5 m²
- Green area: 0.25 * 10 m² = 2.5 m²
- White area: 0.25 * 10 m² = 2.5 m²

2. Calculate the new number of each tile, maintaining whole tiles only:
- Blue tiles: 5 m² / 0.5 m²/tile = 10 tiles (5 / 0.5 = 10).
- Green tiles: Since 2.5 m² is not a multiple","First find the number of cups of banana mush Hannah gets: 20 bananas / 4 bananas/cup = <<20/4=5>>5 cups

Now let's find out how many slices Sammy ate. Since he ate a third of the cheese pizza, he ate 12 / 3 = 4 slices.

Total slices eaten by Dean, Frank, and Sammy: Dean's 6 + Frank's 3 + Sammy's 4 = 13 slices.

995,True,"To solve this problem, we'll let 'J' represent Josh's age when he got married and 'A' represent Anna's age when they got married. Together their combined age when they got married was J + A.

According to the problem, today, their combined age is 5 times what Josh's age was when they married, which can be written as:

30 (Josh's current age, since they've been married for 30 years) + A (Anna's current age) = 5 * J

We know Josh turned 22 when they married, so:

J = 22

Substitute J in the equation:

30 + A = 5 * 22

Now solve for A (Anna's current age):

30 + A = 110
A = 110 - 30
A = 80

Anna's current age is 80 years old.

Now we find Anna's age when they got married:

They are now celebrating 30 years of marriage, therefore Anna's age when they got married would be:

80 - 30 = 50 years old.

996,True,"James needs to pay for the entry fee, drinks, food, and the tip. Let's calculate each of these costs:

1. Entry fee: $20 for all (James + 5 friends)

997,True,"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes in a day. Since each fish has 2 eyes, Oomyapeck eats 22 / 2 = 11 fish.
2. Oomyapeck gives 2 of the fish eyes to his dog. This means he actually ate the eyes of 11 + 2 = 13 fish.
3. Since Oomyapeck ate the eyes of 13 fish, it means there were originally 13 + 2 = 15 fish, because we have to add the two fish eyes given to the dog.
4. Now we know that there were originally 15 fish. They are split equally between Ittymangnark, Kingnook, and Oomyapeck.

998,False,"To calculate how long it will take to fill the pool, we need to find the net rate of filling, which is the rate of water coming in minus the rate of water leaking out. The hose fills at 1.6 gallons per minute, and the leak drains at 0.1 gallons per minute, so the net rate of filling is 1.6 - 0.1 = 1.5 gallons per minute.

With the pool's capacity at 60 gallons and a net filling rate of 1.5 gallons per minute, we can find the time required to fill the pool by dividing the capacity by the net rate:
